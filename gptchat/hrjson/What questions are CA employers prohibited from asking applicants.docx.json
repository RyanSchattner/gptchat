"[\"What questions are employers in California prohibited from asking applicants?\", \"\", \"The California Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibits any non-job-related inquiries of applicants or employees, either verbally or through the use of an application form, that express directly or indirectly a limitation, specification or discrimination as to race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, marital status, sex, age or sexual orientation, or any intent to make such a limitation, specification or discrimination. Interviews should be structured to elicit only information concerning the qualifications and ability to perform the job. Many interview inquiries can expose employers to liability because they may suggest a discriminatory motive or intent by the interviewer. \", \"California employers are generally prohibited from making the following inquires:\", \"Requiring any medical or psychological examination or making any inquiry as to whether an applicant has a mental or physical disability or medical condition. Persons must not be excluded from a job because of a generalization about any disability. \", \"Asking whether the applicant has ever filed a workers' compensation claim. \", \"Asking a job applicant or an employee about an arrest that did not lead to a conviction or about a pretrial or post-trial diversion program. \", \"Asking a job applicant about his or her criminal conviction history until after a conditional offer of employment has been made.  \", \"Asking a job applicant or an employee about convictions for minor marijuana offenses more than two years old. \", \"Asking applicants about salary history information, including compensation and benefits.  \", \"According to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH), \\\"Employers should use caution before requesting information about applicants' or employees' residences, running applicant credit checks pursuant to Labor Code 1024.5, or conducting background searches. While the law does not contain a blanket prohibition on these activities, they are impermissible if used for a discriminatory purpose and may be impermissible if they have a discriminatory impact and are not sufficiently related to a business requirement. And employers may not selectively request such reports.\\\"\", \"Applicants and employees may not be required to submit to or take a polygraph, lie detector or similar test or examination as a condition of employment or continued employment.
