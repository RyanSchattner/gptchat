"[\"Nondiscrimination Rules for Fully-insured Group Health Plans\", \"Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), non-grandfathered, fully insured group health plans will be required to comply for the first time with federal nondiscrimination rules related to compensation that have historically applied only to self-insured health plans. These rules prohibit discrimination in favor of highly compensated individuals (HCIs).\", \"These nondiscrimination rules were set to be effective for plan years beginning on or after Sept. 23, 2010. However, they have been delayed indefinitely, pending the issuance of regulations from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Once regulations are issued, they will specify the new effective date.\", \"The IRS has not issued regulations or any new or additional information on the ACA\\u2019s nondiscrimination rules for fully insured group health plans. Because the nondiscrimination requirement has been delayed indefinitely pending the issuance of regulations, IRS officials have stated that the requirement will not be enforced at this point.\", \"Section 125 Cafeteria Plan Nondiscrimination Rules\", \"Because cafeteria plans offer tax advantages to employers and participants, these plans must meet certain nondiscrimination requirements to ensure that HCIs do not receive a disproportionate amount of tax-advantaged benefits. Specifically, a cafeteria plan must not discriminate in favor of:\", \"HCIs as to eligibility to participate (the eligibility test);\", \"HCIs as to contributions and benefits (the contributions and benefits test); or\", \"Key employees as to concentration of benefits (the key employee concentration test).\", \"If a cafeteria plan is discriminatory, all HCI or key employee participants will face adverse tax consequences.\", \"Nondiscrimination Rules for Fully-Insured Group Health Plans\", \"The ACA requires non-grandfathered, fully insured plans to follow many of the same nondiscrimination rules that, up until now, have applied only to self-funded plans. Because fully insured grandfathered plans are exempt from these rules, existing plans that are designed to favor HCIs may want to make the effort to retain grandfathered status. If grandfathered status is lost, discriminatory plans will have to be amended or face potential excise tax penalties.\", \"Specifically, non-grandfathered, fully insured plans will have to satisfy requirements similar to those in Internal Revenue Code (Code) Section 105(h)(2), which prohibits discrimination in favor of HCIs. This provision generally provides that plans must pass two separate nondiscrimination tests\\u2014the eligibility test and the benefits test.\", \"\", \"For nondiscrimination testing purposes, the Code generally treats two or more employers as a single employer if there is sufficient common ownership or a combination of joint ownership and common activity. The controlled group and affiliated service group rules of Code Sections 414(b), (c) and (m) are expressly applied to nondiscrimination testing under Code Section 105(h)(2).\", \"Eligibility Test\", \"In order to have a nondiscriminatory classification of employees, there must be a bona fide business reason for the classification and a sufficient ratio of non-HCIs must benefit. Examples of reasonable classifications generally include specified job categories, compensation categories (such as hourly or salaried) and geographic location.\", \"In running the eligibility test, an employer may exclude from consideration employees who:\", \"Benefits Test\", \"To pass the benefits test, all benefits provided to the HCIs who participate in the plan must be provided to all other participants as well. Also, all the benefits available for the dependents of HCIs must be available on the same basis for dependents of all other participants. The regulations and IRS guidance indicate that the level of employer contributions should not discriminate in favor of HCIs.\", \"A plan may have a maximum reimbursement limit for any single benefit or combination of benefits, but the maximum limit attributable to employer contributions must be uniform for all participants and their dependents. The limit may not be modified due to a participant's age or years of service.\", \"There are two components to the benefits test. A plan must not:\", \"Discriminate on its face in providing benefits in favor of HCIs; or\", \"Discriminate in favor of HCIs in actual operation (determined on a facts and circumstances basis).\", \"A plan will discriminate on its face if the plan document contains discriminatory provisions that favor HCIs. A plan could discriminate in operation if it is amended or terminated so that the duration of the plan (or benefit) favors HCIs, or if the plan approves certain claims for medical expenses for HCIs but denies them for non-HCIs without a permissible reason for treating them differently. However, a plan will not be considered discriminatory just because HCIs participating in the plan use a broad range of plan benefits to a greater extent than do other employees participating in the plan.\", \"Nondiscrimination Rules Delayed Pending Regulations\", \"As with many areas of health care reform, the law regarding nondiscrimination rules for fully insured plans is unclear.  Recognizing the uncertainty surrounding these rules, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued Notice 2011-1 in December 2010. Notice 2011-1 delays the application of the nondiscrimination rules to insured group health plans until after regulations are issued. The regulations will specify the new effective date.\", \"In Notice 2011-1, the IRS acknowledged that employers would have difficulty complying with the nondiscrimination rules without regulatory guidance. In particular, one provision of the health care reform law states that insured plans must follow rules \\u201csimilar to the rules\\u201d found in Code section 105(h)(3), (4) and (8). This reference means that guidance must specify how insured plans should follow those rules, since the law itself is unclear on this point.\", \"Compliance with the nondiscrimination rules will not be required until after regulations (or other administrative guidance) is issued. In order to give employers time to implement any required changes, the guidance is expected to apply to plan years beginning a certain amount of time after the guidance is issued.\", \"The IRS has not yet released any further guidance on this issue. Thus, the nondiscrimination requirement for fully-insured plans continues to be delayed indefinitely.\"]"
