"[\"Compliance\", \"The biggest struggle with compliance at infinity is the lack of manager training that is provided to new managers.  There are 2 types of trainings that are needed.  1. Manager Compliance \\u2013 this is state required/company required (how to terminate someone, sexual harassment training, what you can and cannot say in an interview, how to issue a disciplinary action, etc.)  & 2. How to be a Manager \\u2013 the talent management side of things, how to grow skills for the team, how to manage difficult situations, etc. \", \"Right now, the training is outside of our department but if we can have training on these items put higher on the list, I feel our exposure will lessen greatly. \", \"Some of our biggest things with compliance is the number of one-off approvals that occur that legally we can't accommodate thus leaving us in a situation that the employee is angry, they have something in writing, we must abide by the contract as not to unfairly pay one person over the other, and then we end up getting sued. Payroll should always be black and white.  We must pay based on the contract with no gray area leaving us vulnerable. The other piece to this is employees not understanding how they get paid, when something is earned, and what to expect.  Managers also need to be aware of how their employees are paid.  Also to add, a review of our pay scales needs to be done.  Pay scales should not be so complicated that they are not easily interpreted.  \", \"For specific examples:\", \"Former employee (terminated in November for cause) reached out to payroll about a job that had installed on 6/5.  HR was added and we explained per the contract \\u2013 an employee must be actively employed to earn commissions. The emails when back and forth but we held to the contract.  He then reached out to the manager in the area who told him he could receive the commission and payroll would overnight the check to the office.  The manager then emailed payroll instructing us to pay the rep and the regional manager responded with \\u201capproved\\u201d without even understanding why this can\\u2019t happen.  I had to reach out to both managers explaining the situation.  I also received an email from our operations manager stating the ex-employee had shown up at the office looking for his check.  This ex-employee is now sending threatening texts to an owner and wrote a negative review.  - This situation could have been avoided IF the employee prior to termination understood how he got paid and if the manager was aware of how his employees got paid.\", \"Former employee (terminated in January for job abandonment) reached out to payroll about a job that had installed beginning of June.  HR was added and we explained per the contract - an employee must be actively employed to earn commissions. We did not hear back from the former employee but he then showed up in the office and asked to speak to payroll in person.  We informed the former employee that they were no longer employed by us and if they needed anything they could reach out via email.  This employee has called multiple times and emailed stating he has proof from Cameron showing he was told he was getting paid.  Again, if the employee understood how he was being paid this situation would have been avoided.\", \"Former employee (terminated in February to move to a dealership) reached out to payroll because he got a text message that his job installed \", \"\", \"One of the other biggest issues, in which we discussed, are the unprofessional comments that are being made.  This issue is really a top-down problem that in my opinion is the easiest to fix and the most potential exposure of all the issues of Infinity compliance.  Our standards for the board, upper management, middle management, and staff needs to be the same.  Period.  Offhanded comments, even if they are intended to be joking, can be misinterpreted leaving infinity at risk.  In California, even if a comment is not directed towards someone, if the individual feels offended, they could make a complaint.  If these complaints are not addressed, it can be viewed as a systemic issue, and this is where Infinity is in great danger of harassment lawsuits.  \", \"Some examples of these issues include:\", \"An owner walking through the front of the building telling other employees that a female manager of a department is a \\u201cfucking idiot\\u201d then going on talking about how he can't stand her, and he can\\u2019t believe she doesn\\u2019t even know who he is - this interaction was inappropriate and made others who overheard it uncomfortable.  \", \"A manager getting on a call with another manager calling an employee a \\u201cfucking cunt\\u201d and then the employee hearing about it.\", \"An owner making fun of someone's age in a joking manager on a call with other employees who are not aware of the relationship between the two individuals then making a claim about how the conversation made her feel uncomfortable due to her own age being the same. \", \"Comments and jokes made about how an employee is sleeping with another employee as a joke being overheard or told to a new employee embarrassing the employee.\", \"An owner sending a text message asking \\u201cDo you want me to slap (female employee)?\\u201d to 2 employees.  One of the employees on the text was a male employee who was already under close watch due to his interactions with female employees.\", \"\", \"Terminations and offboarding in a sales driven company is difficult to get employees to follow the policy.  We have implemented on the sales side a weekly roster check to send out the list of reps who report to a specific manager to get an update on their status.  We then send multiple follows for updates when we receive no response.  There is not a lot of consistency with how employees are let go or how we are notified that an employee is no longer with the company.  On multiple occasions we have received no responses from management only to find out that someone is no longer with the company when a lawsuit is filed or unemployment if filed.  Our termination process is extremely simple (see attached) however, out in the field it is not followed as it should be.  \"]"
