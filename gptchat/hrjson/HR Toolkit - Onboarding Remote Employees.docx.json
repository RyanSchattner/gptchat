During these times, it\\u2019s not just seasoned employees working from home\\u2014it\\u2019s also new hires. Employers are being challenged with the task of onboarding increasingly more remote employees than ever before. Remote onboarding refers to completing an onboarding process primarily or entirely in a virtual or remote fashion, with the intent of that employee primarily telecommuting. This includes acclimating remote hires to their new roles, setting clear guidelines for performance and company culture, and sharing the necessary knowledge for a new employee to succeed within a remote environment. \", \"While, in some cases, remote work is being adopted out of necessity, many employees feel confident in their abilities to fulfill their roles remotely. The Harris Poll conducted a survey on behalf of Glassdoor among nearly 1,000 employed adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Results found that 60% feel confident in doing their job efficiently, even if it means doing their job remotely indefinitely, while 50% believe they would be equally or more productive. With increased utilization of telecommuting, employers can use this opportunity to review current practices and optimize this experience for employees.\", \"Remote work, or \\u201ctelecommuting,\\u201d does bring both advantages and challenges to the way companies do business. Advantages can include boosted productivity, potential cost savings and increased flexibility for employees. Other benefits can include increased retention, reduced greenhouse emissions, the ability to tap into a broader geographical talent pool and more. \", \"There are also challenges to telecommuting, such as the potential for a lack of collaboration, and technology and security concerns. However, this toolkit will provide you with information on best practices for having new employees succeed in a remote environment, and find ways to overcome challenges associated with such environments. \", \"The Importance of the Onboarding Process\", \"Why is onboarding so important? The answer is simple: This is the first chance to show new employees why you do what you do and to set them up for success within your company culture. Onboarding helps develop your brand and can build a positive reputation for your company among talented job seekers. \", \"According to a study by the Wynhurst Group, when employees go through structured onboarding, they are 58% more likely to remain with the organization after three years. When you share your company\\u2019s goals and values with your employees while simultaneously showing them how to do their jobs, everyone benefits.\", \"Moreover, employers who do not take onboarding seriously risk losing the new employees they spent so long trying to get in the door. In fact, the average company loses 17% of its new hires during the first three months, according to the Harvard Business Review. The importance of the first 90 days cannot be overstated. Use the resources in this toolkit to strengthen your remote onboarding program and retain your talent. Ignoring this process now can lead to consequences in the future.\", \"Technology Planning\", \"An effective technology experience can be key to having successful remote onboarding outcomes. Many potential technology-related issues can be avoided by utilizing proper planning and putting effective practices in place. \", \"Before the First Day\", \"As you set expectations for the new employee, ensure technology-specific expectations are clearly articulated through the recruiting and onboarding process. For remote hires, expectations of the employee\\u2019s remote workstation will be vital for success on Day One, as well as planning for how the employee will be receiving the equipment, and policies and practices of your organization. \", \"Planning for the Employee\\u2019s Workstation\", \"Notably, a remote employee\\u2019s workstation will revolve around a computer that the employee will be using for work. Outlined in this toolkit are different strategies and policies employers can consider, such as having the employee use a company-owned computer, or having the new hire use an employee-owned computer through a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy. An employer should be prepared and prioritize having a high-functioning computer ready to go for the new employee on Day One.\", \"For reference of common components of a remote workstation setup, review the Remote Workstation Checklist, which can be found in the Appendix. Employers will want to determine which components of the workstation they will provide and which components will be provided by the employee. To plan for an ergonomic workstation setup, review the Ergonomic Workstation Checklist, which also can be found in the Appendix.\", \"Expectations of the Employee\", \"The employee should be expected to have access to an ergonomic, available work location with a quality internet connection and minimal distractions during planned work hours. \", \"A minimum of 1.5 Mbps (megabytes per second) is a good benchmark for bandwidth requirements. For reference, popular video-conference tool Zoom recommends a minimum of 1.2 Mbps of bandwidth to best use their software for high-definition video calls, according to their website. This requirement could vary depending on the types of tasks the new employee will be completing to be successful in his or her role, and should be clearly communicated as part of the recruiting or onboarding process. \", \"Expectations for the new employee may also include preparing some or all components of his or her workstation, and employers can consider different options for getting necessary equipment to the employee prior to or on their first day. \", \"\", \"\", \"Getting Equipment to the Employee\", \"Options for planning the setup of the remote employee\\u2019s workstation include:\", \"Provide equipment to the new employee on their first day. As COVID-19 influences updates to employment laws and employment practices, you may still be able to meet with your new remote employee if they are local. If your local laws allow for it, consider meeting with new hires at the office to welcome them to the company, get them set up with any necessary equipment and deliver any printed training materials. Be sure to test the equipment to make sure it works before you both leave the office. Keep social distancing guidelines in mind when meeting with new hires, and avoid shaking hands to prevent the spread of COVID-19. \", \"Ship equipment to the new employee in advance of their first day. If you won\\u2019t be meeting with the new remote employee on their first day, employers can also consider shipping equipment and materials. This may include some or all of the equipment for the employee\\u2019s workstation and relevant printed materials. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, keep in mind that shipping times may be delayed. Ensure that all necessary equipment reaches the new employee prior to his or her first day. \", \"Have remote employees provide their own devices through a BYOD policy. Employers can consider a BYOD policy, allowing employees to provide laptops, other mobile devices or other components of their workstation that they will be using. \", \"As you plan the new employee\\u2019s workstation, your strategy for delivering equipment to the new employee could include a combination of the above options.\", \"Electronic Devices\", \"When planning for an employee\\u2019s workstation, consider establishing best practices for both company-owned and employee-owned devices. These devices include but are not limited to the computer that the remote employee will be using for work. \", \"Company-owned Devices\", \"If the new employee will be using a company-owned computer or other devices, make sure to have a plan in place. Plan ahead for how the workstation can be set up ahead of time so that the new employee can have a seamless transition on Day One. This may include having your IT department set up the computer with necessary software, ensuring the new employee has clear how-to guides on how to use necessary tools, and has any passwords or credentials that they\\u2019ll need to get started. \", \"Even when using a company device, remote employees aren\\u2019t immune to cyber security threats and other challenges. Employers may want to consider best practices to put in place for remote employees who will be accessing company networks. Review the Remote Cyber Security Overview and Cyber Policies for Company-owned Devices sections of this toolkit for examples of best practices and policies that employers can consider for remote employees. \", \"Personal Devices\", \"BYOD refers to the practice of allowing employees to use their own personal devices, usually laptops, at and for work. The growing trend of BYOD is fueled by several factors, one of which is an effort to attract and retain new, younger employees who have a high level of familiarity with technology as well as preferences for which devices they use. Other reasons companies adopt BYOD include the potential for reducing costs, increasing productivity and enabling employees to work flexible hours and from remote locations. \", \"Within a BYOD program, employers can also consider the option of providing remote employees a \\u201ctechnology stipend.\\u201d This can help in providing some of the benefits of a BYOD program while removing some of the financial stress for the employee. \", \"Although a BYOD policy offers many attractive qualities, several legal, financial, security and privacy considerations come with it that are unique to employee-owned devices. Most issues stem from poor security on the device and thus unsecured company data. If you take insufficient steps or, worse, don\\u2019t do anything to protect your company\\u2019s information and interests, your data could become susceptible to unauthorized access. Laws on both federal and state levels address protection of personally identifiable or sensitive personal information. Because of these laws and the penalties associated with noncompliance, employers may want proper safeguards that could be placed on employees\\u2019 use of personal devices that contain sensitive information.\", \"Review the Remote Cyber Security Overview and Cyber Policies for Personal Devices sections of this toolkit to plan for how some of these challenges can be best managed. \", \"Remote Cyber Security Overview\", \"When onboarding remote employees, there are some general considerations employers can plan for when considering remote cyber security practices. General considerations for employers include how to best plan for cyber security breaches, remote network setup, device setup and cyber policies. \", \"Businesses both large and small may want to consider how they can best be proactive in order to protect against growing cyber threats. The following cyber security considerations are not intended to be exhaustive nor should any discussion or opinions be construed as legal advice. It is generally recommended that businesses using sophisticated networks with dozens of computers consult a cyber security expert and legal counsel in addition to using the following cyber security planning guidance. \", \"Remote Cyber Security Breaches\", \"The majority of cyber criminals are indiscriminate when choosing their victims. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asserts that cyber criminals will target vulnerable computer systems regardless of whether the systems belong to a Fortune 500 company, a small business or a home user. When planning for remote work, consider that attacks on devices used remotely for work are also at risk of a security breach.   \", \"A breach in cyber security can lead to unauthorized usage of a remote computer through tactics such as the following:\", \"Installing spyware that allows the hacker to track internet activity, and steal information and passwords.\", \"Deceiving recipients of phishing emails into disclosing personal information.\", \"Tricking recipients of spam email into giving hackers access to the computer system.\", \"Installing viruses that allow hackers to steal, corrupt or delete information, or even crash the entire system.\", \"Hijacking the company website and rerouting visitors to a fraudulent look-alike site and subsequently stealing personal information from clients or consumers.\", \"Security Checklist\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"Regardless of whether the new hire will be using a company or employee-owned computer, cyber security should be a companywide effort.

One of the most effective and least expensive means of preventing serious cyber security incidents is to establish cyber security policies for remote use of both company-owned devices and networks. \", \"The following are a few specific elements of an effective policy:\", \"Define what types of company-owned equipment, network and data use are\\nacceptable within policy. \", \"Stipulate which apps are allowed and forbidden, and determine how this will be enforced.\", \"Set strict security procedures that include complex passwords in order to access the device and company networks. \", \"Define what types of personal use, if any, are allowed on the company-owned device.\", \"Establish a company virtual private network (VPN) for use on the employees\\u2019 home broadband network.\", \"Additional security options are also worth exploring, such as multifactor authentication, providing cyber security awareness training and keeping IT resources well-staffed.\", \"Depending on the types of data regularly handled by your business, it may also make sense to create separate policies governing who is responsible for certain types of data. For example, this may mean limiting access to data and sensitive company or client information for employees who do not require it to complete job functions. \", \"When creating or changing policies, employers should consult with IT departments as to the feasibility and reasonableness of suggested policies, as well as consulting with local legal counsel. \", \"Cyber Policies for Personal Devices\", \"Through a BYOD policy, employers have the option of allowing employees to use their own devices for work. While allowing employees to use personal devices for work offers various benefits, there are serious consequences if something goes wrong and your company is not protected with a written and signed BYOD policy. Implementing a written BYOD policy will help reduce some of the uncertainties and risks associated with this growing technological trend. \", \"Employers are recommended to create written guidelines for security measures that employees can take when they carry company information on their personal devices. A written policy should outline general rules about device use and the rights and obligations of both the employer and employee. It is important to maintain a balance between protecting company interests and respecting employees\\u2019 expectations for privacy. Anything that might be perceived as a violation of privacy should be clearly outlined.\", \"The following are a few specific elements to consider when creating an effective BYOD policy:\", \"Clearly state which devices are allowed under the BYOD policy.\", \"Specify who owns what on the device. If your company retains the right to wipe the entire device, provide guidelines for how employees can back up personal data such as photos and contact lists.\", \"Outline what IT support will be provided to the employee.\", \"Describe the process for removing company information from a device owned by an employee who is leaving the organization.\", \"Integrate your current acceptable use policy into the BYOD policy.\", \"Establish a company VPN for employee use on home broadband networks.\", \"Consult with your legal and IT departments as to the feasibility and reasonableness of suggested policies.\", \"Also, ensure that your BYOD guidelines are legally and reasonably enforceable. You may not be able to prohibit certain activities on an employee-owned device, but you can at least manage or limit undesirable behaviors. Further, it is essential that you enforce the policy consistently. A policy is only as good as the enforcement behind it, and if you do not require equal adherence from all employees, you could expose your company to discrimination lawsuits. When creating or changing policies, make sure to consult with IT as well as local legal counsel. \", \"\", \"Set the Foundation Early\", \"Simply offering training courses to new hires will not be sufficient for remote onboarding. Employers should consider all the smaller aspects that create an efficient and painless transition into the company, particularly in a remote role. This means working with stakeholders well before new hires start. Establishing a strong remote onboarding foundation prior to Day One can be key for long-term success. This section discusses some tips for doing just that.\", \"Be Realistic About Job Descriptions and Expectations\", \"Give new hires realistic previews of their jobs and make sure the descriptions are as honest as possible. Doing so will guarantee that you and the new hires are on the same page and have the same job expectations. This can help retain new employees, since confusion or uncertainty can cause new hires to quit soon after starting. Surprised about their responsibilities is the last thing your new hires should feel on their first day. Ensuring new employees understand their positions in advance helps reduce the chance of them feeling ill-equipped when learning their new roles. Ensure that this includes remote workstation and schedule expectations, and any travel requirements that the positions may require. \", \"Preboard New Hires\", \"Everyone remembers how stressful the first day of a job can be. Help alleviate some of that stress by preboarding. This process involves sending new hires any information they may find useful in advance of Day One. Sending the following information beforehand can help reduce new employees\\u2019 stress and prepare them for a busy first day:\", \"A welcome letter or email\", \"A detailed schedule for the employee\\u2019s first week\", \"A welcome kit, including Information about the company and the industry\", \"Specific plans for delivery and setup of the employee\\u2019s technology and workstation\", \"Information about a BYOD policy, if applicable\", \"Helpful first-day resources, including a schedule and information about who their manager or mentor will be\", \"Essential HR and tax forms\", \"Any necessary links for virtual meetings or video conferences\", \"Passwords and credentials for initial login\", \"\", \"\", \"State-specific Considerations and Employer Liability\", \"As with on-site employees, employers should have a plan in place for remote employees in regard to employer liability and legal concerns. What happens if an employee slips and falls at home, while on the clock? Or what if an employee commits a crime in the scope of his or her employment while telecommuting? What about workers' compensation? What state is the remote employee legally employed in?\", \"Employer liability remains a considerable concern for telecommuting employees. Note that employment compliance for remote employees can vary from state to state. As guidelines can vary, make sure to consult with local legal counsel for legal advice. \", \"Formalize the Remote Onboarding Process\", \"Make sure the remote onboarding process is formalized, including your training and orientation. This does not mean the process has to be boring\\u2014merely that training should not be ad-libbed by staff at the last minute when the new hires arrive. A formalized onboarding process can go on for days, weeks or even months. Make the most of this opportunity and get new hires up to speed on everything going on within your organization. Explain your company\\u2019s structure, its place in the industry and its management hierarchy. Above all, make sure remote hires are getting the same training as everyone else in their departments. Formalizing the remote onboarding process will ease the tensions of starting in new remote roles.\", \"\", \"A Successful First Week\", \"One of the most common mistakes employers make with onboarding plans is not setting clear expectations. Because your onboarding process may now be done remotely and you\\u2019re not there in-person to monitor a new hire\\u2019s progress, setting expectations becomes even more important. Expectations that should be discussed include the company\\u2019s values, the team\\u2019s objectives and the new hire\\u2019s responsibilities.\", \"Orientation Delivery\", \"Training new hires remotely isn\\u2019t always ideal for managers or the new employee. As such, prioritize the training and only train new hires on the skills that are absolutely essential for them to be able to do their job. As they progress into learning more about their role, there will be plenty of opportunities for more advanced training. \", \"An Effective Orientation Schedule\", \"Planning out the schedule for the new employee can be a stress reliever. Make sure to be very clear with the employee\\u2019s to-do list for the week, which should coincide with his or her schedule. Set clear expectations ahead of time, and make sure to pass along a checklist of steps that should be completed to the employee. Giving clear guidelines on how to accomplish tasks will make the employee feel confident and at home. \", \"On top of introductions and learning materials, an orientation schedule will need to include time for tasks such as:\", \"Benefits enrollment\", \"Direct deposit setup\", \"Policy acknowledgments\", \"HR overview\", \"IT overview\", \"Completion of HR forms\", \"Consider that, for documents such as policies and the employee handbook, there should be remote-specific dialogue and expectations. An example would be an anti-harassment policy, which should have specific guidelines for remote behavior. Consider reviewing the Remote Anti-harassment Policy included in the Appendix of this toolkit as a guideline for what this policy could look like. \", \"\", \"Content and Content Delivery\", \"An effective onboarding experience will have content that keeps a new employee engaged, but will also be informative. Consider how you can develop remote content and a content delivery strategy that won\\u2019t just be engaging, but successfully deliver key points about the company overview, values and organizational goals, while providing necessary new employee steps and role-specific training. \", \"Content delivery could include many channels:\", \"Video calls\", \"Prerecorded videos\", \"Emailed documents\", \"In-person presentations (if the employee is visiting the office to begin orientation)\", \"In the first week, the new employee should be spending time with IT to learn about best practices and tools that they will be using. After these training sessions, you should direct the employee to centralized channels of information where talent can access how-to guides and FAQs easily. With the influx of content the new hire will be taking in in their first week, this will allow the new hire to continue to reference any necessary information as they become more familiar with necessary tools and available resources. \", \"Introductions\", \"Whether in person or remotely via a video-conference, face-to-face interactions allow the new employee to feel welcomed and make connections with his or her teammates and peers. \", \"Set a goal of having an introduction or check-in between the new employee and their supervisor on Day One, if at all possible. Through the first week, set time aside for the new employee to get acclimated to each individual member on his or her team. \", \"Preparing a Remote Form I-9 Process\", \"Completing Form I-9 is part of any onboarding process, and the process may change if onboarding a remote employee. As required by law, Form I-9 document verification requirements typically are satisfied as part of an in-person orientation process within the first three days of employment. If the employee will be physically attending on Day One, this process can proceed as standard. For a remote I-9 Verification process, the new employee can complete Section 1 remotely; however, documentation will need to be verified for the employer to complete Section 2. Some vendors offer local I-9 verification remotely through local employment offices, notaries and more. \", \"On March 20, 2020, in response to COVID-19, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced flexibility in requirements related to Form I-9 compliance. Temporarily, employers have the option of reviewing the employee\\u2019s identity and employment authorization documents either in the employee\\u2019s physical presence or virtually. Employers may choose to inspect necessary documents remotely, through email, fax or video. If reviewing documents remotely, employers will then be required to review the physical documents once the temporary flexibility is lifted. \", \"As of Jan. 31, 2020, employers are advised by U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services to begin using the new version of Form I-9 released on Oct. 21, 2019. Note that, beginning May 1, 2020, employers will be required to use the new version of the form. \", \"Effective Communication Channels\", \"Given that the employee will be primarily communicating remotely, the employee should be trained on the various communication channels that they will be using, and where they can find the updates and news that they need. These can include:\", \"Intranet\", \"Email alerts\", \"Internal social-media tool \", \"Employee handbook\", \"Conference or video calls\", \"The new remote employee won\\u2019t be hearing updates word-of-mouth, so it is important to be intentional about sharing all necessary updates. \", \"Initial Projects and Responsibilities\", \"While new hires shouldn\\u2019t be overloaded with work in their first week, many new hires will be eager to make an impact. Plan ahead for how new hires can be involved with a project in their first week. While new hires will be able to ease into their eventual workload, create opportunities for small accomplishments within their first days of employment. Even small tasks and projects will allow the new employee to feel as if he or she is adding value, and will help to begin developing employee engagement.\", \"Checking in Daily\", \"Having employees work from home can help keep them healthy, but it can become isolating, especially for new hires. Schedule a daily call or video chat to help new hires feel like part of the team and allow them the opportunity to ask questions.\", \"Inclusivity\", \"When deciding whom to include in the remote onboarding process, do not just think about the people who are involved in the new hires\\u2019 day-to-day operations. Include other stakeholders like HR managers, executives and anyone else who may be important in the company as a whole. Have these people introduce themselves, along with their roles, and encourage them to extend an open line of communication. Do not be afraid to virtually introduce new hires to important clients either, if appropriate. Doing so can help new employees by providing a glimpse of whom they will be working with on a regular basis\\u2014plus, it reassures clients that they will continue to be taken care of.\", \"Recruit a Mentor\", \"Assigning mentors to new hires can be invaluable to the remote onboarding process. Sun Microsystems conducted a study that looked at data from more than 1,000 of its employees over a five-year period and found that its mentoring program led to positive results for a majority of the workforce. According to the study, 25% of employees who participated in the test group had a salary grade change, compared to the 5% who did not participate. \", \"Additionally, mentors were promoted six times more often, and mentees were promoted five times more often than those not in the program. Retention rates were also higher\\u201469% for mentors and 72% for mentees, compared to a 49% retention rate for employees who did not participate in the program.   \", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"For remote employees, having a strong mentor can be an advantage for the new employee as he or she begins to navigate the remote work environment.\", \"New hires are not the only ones who can gain from the mentoring experience. Offering the chance to advise others can increase a mentor\\u2019s confidence and overall job satisfaction. Organizations that provide mentoring support show that they care about their employees and that they are invested in the long term. Additionally, it displays confidence in the mentor to groom new employees for success.\", \"\", \"Follow Through With New Hires\", \"Remember, successful remote onboarding does not happen overnight. It takes dedication and follow-through from both the new hires and whoever is guiding them. An easy pitfall to slip into is leaving new hires to their own devices during the onboarding period, perhaps to review training materials. Try to avoid isolating new employees, and instead encourage them to talk with others and establish contacts who can help them with questions during their onboarding. This section details some of the ways you can help foster a productive onboarding process for new employees while keeping them engaged throughout it.\", \"Make Remote Onboarding Exciting\", \"While new hires are going through training and orientation, incorporate activities that liven up the process and make them feel involved. Sitting through a series of training lectures makes for a very long day, and new hires are likely to feel burned out after a while. Consider the following activities to help jazz up your training program:\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"In short, show that your company is not just going through an administrative hiring process\\u2014new hires were chosen for a reason, and the company acknowledges the value that they will bring to the organization. Make new hires proud to be working for you by showing your appreciation for them.\", \"Establish Management Expectations\", \"It is important that managers contact new hires on Day One and make sure they have an open conversation about their roles in the department and in the company as a whole. This would be a good time to give a tour (or virtual tour of company or team content), introduce them to other team members, establish a mentor and reiterate the company\\u2019s cultural expectations.\", \"Managers should share department goals and the method for tracking these goals early on. It also reinforces the fact that new hires are part of a larger team, working toward greater company goals.  \", \"Apart from the department and company goals, managers should also lay out clear guidelines for new hire success. This can look different depending on the organization, but it typically includes communicating team expectations, identifying personal responsibilities and having a clear path for the onboarding process. Essentially, new hires should not have to guess what their managers are expecting from them. Establishing expectations early on will help new hires understand their place in the organization.\", \"Proactively Ensure Remote Workstation Is Functioning Effectively\", \"Set up a standard process to check in with the new employee regarding his or her workstation. This should be done regularly\\u2013a new employee may be nervous about asking for help if something isn\\u2019t functioning properly, so by setting aside time to make them feel comfortable about bringing up concerns, this will ensure any issues are addressed. \", \"Consider an Intranet Site\", \"Many organizations have an internal website (or intranet site) specifically for employees to access important company information. Unfortunately, employees do not always find these sites useful or engaging. Consider using an intranet site and stocking it with resources you know new hires will need. Examples of important resources include an employee handbook, training schedules, an employee directory and links to industry websites. During onboarding, be sure to demonstrate this site and ask new employees to explore it.\", \"Prerecord Trainings\", \"Training via live or prerecorded video for those in remote locations, instead of paying for travel costs, is another way of using technology to your advantage. Consider pairing prerecorded sessions with software that can quiz and track trainees\\u2019 progress online. Having remote learning opportunities like this can make scheduling much easier and allows new hires to learn at their own pace. This is especially important to consider when you have Generation Z individuals entering the workforce (those born between 1995 and 2010), since they are accustomed to getting the majority of information via technology.\", \"Use a Company Networking Platform\", \"There is a growing need for companies\\u2014including yours\\u2014to think about social networking. Platforms like Yammer and Chatter provide resources for employees to build meaningful connections within the organization. These platforms act similarly to social media sites like Facebook, but they are protected behind your company\\u2019s firewall and only accessible by your employees. This can be a great way to engage with employees in a more casual way, which can be welcoming for new hires.\", \"Think Outside the Box\", \"Do not be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to onboarding. Remember, the process is about integrating new hires into your company culture and helping them transition into their new roles. A formalized process that offers a variety of useful information is integral, but trying different things can be useful too. In fact, offering a variety of teaching methods and platforms can actually increase the success of your program. Keep in mind that you can extend onboarding for as long as you deem necessary. Some onboarding programs continue for months. Determine what success looks like for new hires at your company and tailor your onboarding process to achieve that goal.\", \"Retain Remote New Hires With Career Pathing\", \"Your goal as a company should be retaining the talented individuals you spent a significant amount of time and money recruiting. A recruiter\\u2019s worst nightmare is having new hires leave after a few months. With this in mind, it is paramount that you define clear paths for new hires within the organization. Let them know where their position can lead if they stay with your company, or what career opportunities there are in other departments. The key is to keep them even if they decide the roles they were hired for do not align with their ultimate career goals. \", \"If new hires are not acclimating well to their new position, do not give up without a fight. Help plot a course for internal career development opportunities that align better with the new hire\\u2019s interests. Let new employees know that they have a future with the company. Explain how individuals in similar roles have moved across departments and found success. You spent a lot of time recruiting and onboarding these individuals, so you should do everything you can to keep them and not waste those resources.\", \"Engage Early, Often and Intentionally\", \"According to Gallup, only 30% of the U.S. workforce feels engaged in their work. The rest are either not engaged or, even worse, actively disengaged. Employees who are not engaged show a lack of enthusiasm and are less committed to their workplaces. Actively disengaged employees are more likely to steal from their employers, negatively influence their co-workers, miss workdays and drive customers away. Disengaged employees cost the United States an average of $500 billion each year in lost productivity. This illustrates how important engagement during the onboarding process can be.\", \"To feel engaged, new hires must understand that what they will be doing matters to the company and that their performance will make a difference. Illustrate the impact of new employees\\u2019 roles in the company by encouraging your workforce to own their work and to take pride in what they do. You should be engaging with new hires and stressing these points throughout the onboarding process.\", \"An employee engagement survey is a great starting place for addressing this issue. Many consulting firms offer such surveys, but you can also create and conduct one on your own. They typically gauge opinions on management, direct supervisors, co-workers, employer-employee communication, opportunities for advancement, job characteristics and HR policies. Consider asking new employees to complete the survey after 90 days of employment, once they have a chance to form opinions. \", \"By identifying areas that are hindering employee engagement, your company can focus on improving those areas so it can move toward a more engaged, productive and profitable workforce. Engaging early and often in the onboarding process can get new hires accustomed to having dialogues with their managers. This open communication can pay off hugely and help encourage employees to speak up when they have concerns. If engagement is ignored during onboarding, employees may be less likely to speak up down the road.\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"While it can be easy to assume that employees may be able to fare well on their own in the office, remote employees should be engaged very intentionally by managers. \", \"The onboarding process should lead to continued engagement for the new employee. Begin to plan for how your teams can succeed in a virtual environment. While the first 90 days are important, processes should be developed with a bigger picture in mind. \", \"\", \"The First 90 Days\\nSetting Up Remote Employees for Success\", \"As you design a remote onboarding process\\u2014remember that updating and improving processes will be an ongoing effort. By taking appropriate steps, employers can ensure that the remote onboarding experience goes as smoothly as possible for each new employee, while continuously evaluating the process. By using checklists, surveys, and continuing ongoing discussions with new hires, employers can evaluate and improve their onboarding programs for remote employees.  \", \"Use Checklists to Stay on Top\", \"Keeping track of new hires\\u2019 onboarding progress can be overwhelming for even the most seasoned HR team. Consider utilizing a simple checklist to navigate the onboarding process in a way that creates a welcoming atmosphere and a long-term relationship. The Remote Onboarding Checklist listed in the Appendix can be used as a starting point for you to create an onboarding plan, whether it used by a hiring manager, manager or mentor.\", \"Use Surveys for Benchmarking\", \"Part of a successful onboarding process involves listening to employee feedback and using that feedback to make changes as needed. Consider asking each employee to complete a short survey after 90 days of employment\\u2014when he or she has finished the onboarding process and has had time to become acclimated to his or her job, yet still remembers specifics about the experience.\", \"Deciding whether to keep the survey responses anonymous depends on what you expect from the survey\\u2019s results. It is sometimes difficult to make necessary onboarding changes when you don\\u2019t know the details surrounding anonymous survey responses. However, you are more likely to get honest answers this way. Companies like SurveyMonkey\\u2014whose website allows you to customize and distribute surveys directly through its servers\\u2014are popular choices for employers who choose to keep employee responses anonymous. Another route is to directly email a survey to each employee, expecting complete transparency so that you can more easily adjust your processes. \", \"Some examples of onboarding survey questions include the following:\", \"Hiring Process\", \"Was the job description clear and understandable?\", \"Was the HR contact professional and knowledgeable during the hiring process?\", \"Was the length of time between the submission of your application and the employer\\u2019s response reasonable?\", \"Was the length of time between the submission of your application and the job offer reasonable?\", \"Are you satisfied with the hiring process overall?\", \"Technology\", \"Were remote expectations clearly communicated prior to your start date?\", \"Did your workstation function effectively?\", \"When you needed IT support, were you able to receive friendly and timely assistance?\", \"Branding\", \"Before applying for this job, were you familiar with the company?\", \"Were you sent information before the first day that helped you know what to expect before beginning your employment?\", \"During your onboarding session, were you provided with concise information regarding the following:\", \"The company\\u2019s mission?\", \"Your role in the department and the company?\", \"The organizational structure?\", \"First Day\", \"Was your team ready for you to begin? \", \"Were you welcomed by your manager and introduced to your team?\", \"Was your remote workstation effectively planned for?\", \"Was the information you received about employee benefits clear and helpful?\", \"Was the information you received about personnel policies clear and helpful?\", \"Did you know who to contact regarding specific questions after your first day?\", \"First Month\", \"Were you assigned proper training during your first month?\", \"Did you know what was expected of you during your first month?\", \"Did you know where to get the answers to your questions?\", \"Was the performance management system explained to you?\", \"First 90 Days\", \"Did you receive ongoing feedback from your supervisor about your performance?\", \"Is the work you are doing now consistent with what was described in the job posting and during the interview process?\", \"Are you satisfied with the overall orientation that you received?\", \"General Remote Onboarding Process Questions\", \"What was your motivation for choosing and accepting this position?\", \"Do you have any recommendations for improving our recruitment, hiring or remote onboarding processes?\", \"Is there any additional feedback that you can share?\", \"How would you evaluate your remote onboarding and orientation process? \", \"\", \"Summary\", \"Onboarding remote employees the right way can improve retention and save money, while building upon your company\\u2019s culture and brand.
