"[\"IRS Q&As on Form W-2 Reporting \", \"The Affordable Care Act (ACA) added Internal Revenue Code (Code) Section 6051(a)(14), which requires employers to report the cost of employer-sponsored group health plan coverage on their employees\\u2019 Forms W-2. \", \"This reporting requirement was originally effective for the 2011 tax year. However, to allow employers more time to update their payroll systems, the IRS later made reporting optional for all employers in 2011. In addition, the IRS made this requirement optional for certain smaller employers for 2012 and later Forms W-2 until further guidance is issued.\", \"The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued Q&As to provide information on a variety of issues related to the Form W-2 reporting requirement, including information on transition relief for 2012, how to report, which coverage to include and how to determine the cost of the coverage. This ACA Overview contains the IRS\\u2019 Q&A guidance on this requirement.\", \"\", \"Q1. Does the cost of an employee\\u2019s health care benefits shown on the Form W-2 mean that the benefits are taxable to the employee?\", \"No. There is nothing about the reporting requirement that causes or will cause excludable employer-provided health coverage to become taxable. The purpose of the reporting requirement is to provide employees useful and comparable consumer information on the cost of their health care coverage.\", \"Q2. When did employers have to start reporting the cost of health care coverage on the Form\\u00a0W2?\", \"Reporting for the 2011 calendar year (meaning the Form W-2 generally required to be furnished to employees in January 2012) was optional. For the 2012 calendar year and for future years, employers generally are required to report the cost of health benefits provided on the Form W-2. \", \"Transition relief is available for certain employers and with respect to certain types of coverage, as explained in Q&A-4, below. Reporting for employers covered by the transition relief, and with respect to the types of coverage covered by the transition relief, is not required until future guidance is provided, and in no event will such reporting by these employers and with respect to these types of coverage be required on any 2012 Forms W-2 or on a Form W-2 for a subsequent year until future guidance is issued.\", \"Q3. Which employers are subject to this reporting requirement?\", \"Except as provided in the transition relief described in Q4, all employers that provide \\u201capplicable employer-sponsored coverage\\u201d (see Q5 below) under a group health plan are subject to the reporting requirement. This includes federal, state and local government entities (except with respect to plans maintained primarily for members of the military and their families), churches and other religious organizations, and employers that are not subject to the COBRA continuation coverage requirements, but does not include federally recognized Indian tribal governments or, until further guidance, any tribally chartered corporation wholly owned by a federally recognized Indian tribal government.\", \"Third-party sick-pay providers that provide the Forms W-2 to the employees of the employers with which they have contracted do not have to report the cost of coverage. However, a Form W-2 provided by the employer to the employee must report the cost of coverage regardless of whether that Form W-2 includes sick pay or whether a third-party sick pay provider is furnishing a separate Form W-2 reporting the sick pay.\", \"Q4. What transition relief is provided by Notice 2012-9? To which employers and types of coverage does it apply and how long does it last?\", \"For certain employers and with respect to certain types of coverage listed below, the requirement to report the cost of coverage did not apply for the 2012 Forms W-2 (the forms required for the calendar year 2012 that employers generally were required to provide employees in January 2013) and will not apply for future calendar years until the IRS publishes guidance giving at least six months of advance notice of any change to the transition relief.\\u00a0However, reporting by these employers and for these types of coverages may be made on a voluntary basis.\", \"The transition relief applies to the following:\", \"Employers filing fewer than 250 Forms W-2 for the previous calendar year (for example, employers filing fewer than 250 2012 Forms W-2\\u2014meaning Forms W-2 for the 2012 calendar year, which generally are filed with the SSA in early 2013\\u2014will not be required to report the cost of coverage on the 2013 Forms W-2, which generally are filed with the SSA in early 2014).

What types of health coverage must be included in the amount reported on Form W-2?\", \"The IRS provides a chart that\\u00a0lists many types of health care coverage and various other situations, and explains whether reporting is required, prohibited or optional.\", \"The chart was created at the suggestion of, and in collaboration with, the IRS\\u2019 Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee (IRPAC). IRPAC\\u2019s members are representatives of industries responsible for providing information returns, such as Form W-2, to the IRS. IRPAC works with IRS to improve the information reporting process.\", \"Q6. What amount should the employer report on the Form W-2 for health coverage? The amount the employer paid, the amount the employee paid, or both?\", \"In general, the amount reported should include both the portion paid by the employer and the portion paid by the employee. In the case of a health FSA, the amount reported should not include the amount of any salary reduction contributions. See Notice 2012-9 for more detail on the interim rules that apply to reporting contributions to a health FSA.\", \"\", \"\", \"Q7. Where on the Form W-2 should the employer report the cost of these health benefits?\", \"The cost of these health care benefits will be reported in box 12 of the Form W-2, with Code DD, to identify the amount.\", \"Q8. What amount of health benefits should be reported on the Form W-2 for employees that\\u00a0terminated employment during the year and had employer-provided coverage both before and after termination?\", \"Under the interim rules,\\u00a0the employer may use any reasonable method\\u00a0for inclusion of the coverage provided after termination, so long as that method is applied consistently. See Notice 2012-9, Q6, for examples.\", \"Q9.\\u00a0What amount of health benefits should be reported on the Form W-2 for\\u00a0an employee that leaves during the year and requests a W-2\\u00a0before the end\\u00a0of the year?\", \" If an employee makes a request in writing, the employer must provide the W-2 within 30 days.
