"[\"\", \"Hiring at Infinity Energy\", \"\", \"The Infinity Story\", \"Infinity started as an alarm company in 2013 and went by the name Infinity Technologies, INC.  The owners at the time Cameron Kelly and Cory Gilbert had years of door-to-door experience between them and a vision to grow a company that created local solutions to customers.  You may have heard the stories of companies starting in a garage and becoming well know successful business and that is exactly the case with Infinity.  Infinity was indeed started in a garage.  Cameron at the time had set up inventory in his garage and hired a few technicians to install alarm systems and had a handful of sales reps who would go door to door selling the alarm systems.  With only one back-office support person it was small but quickly things picked up.  Infinity was selling 50 or so alarms a week and decided it was time to move out of the garage and into an office...From there things never slowed down.  \", \"Cameron and Cory brought on Mark Stacy who had a background in creating successful sales teams and Mark made it clear right off the bat that he was indeed looking to build!  After about a year or so of consistent sales and growth, Infinity Technologies decided to diversify and that is when Infinity Energy came to be.  With the start of Infinity Energy, Cameron, Cory and Mark brought on two additional partners Bryson Solomon and Jon LaPray.  Bryson had years of experience in construction and Jon was well... He was there.  Kidding aside Jon brought on the levelheaded business mind to the equation.  \", \"One of the greatest things about the ownership is their personality differences that together create a wonderful team.  Cameron is the one to prove people wrong with the drive and desire to outdo all expectations.  He is unwilling to stop and will do what it takes to make sure the business is stable.  This sounds great but sometimes you need a person to bring things into reality.  This is where Cory can excel.  He is what we lovingly say is our chicken little.  He is the money man who can see the other side of things and put it in perspective (or in other words puts a stop to the things that may \", \"But the absolute best thing about Infinity is our people.  The people at Infinity are what make this company so successful. Our culture at Infinity is one that you will never experience again in your life.  We are a team, we know how get things done while having the ability to create our own workflows, be heard, and make changes.  Whether you are entry level or in upper management, your voice is heard.  If you have a suggestion, it is listened to.  If you have an idea, it is taken into consideration.  \", \"Well, with all this being said, let's get into the fun stuff!  Hiring at Infinity!\", \"What is an Effective Interview?\", \"A good job interview is an interview in which the person doing the hiring gathers sufficient information from a job applicant to find out if the candidate has the needed knowledge, skills and abilities to do the job itself as well as the characteristics and competencies for a good \\u201cfit\\u201d for the organization for both parties.  At Infinity, we are not your typical corporate environment, and it is good to keep in mind when conducting an interview that the person you are hiring will be joining a fairly new company.  We are not a \\u201cthis is your standard day\\u201d kind of company as each day can be something new so the ability to adapt and grow is key to work at Infinity in any position.  A good job interview not only identifies these qualifications but does so within the parameters of the law.\", \"What IS a Legal Interview?\", \"A number of federal, state and local laws have been enacted to protect against discrimination in employment.  Although Infinity operates in multiple states and local areas, we want always to ensure our interviews are conducted with respect to all potential hires.  If you are conducting an interview you need to know who is protected by these laws and how to respect these laws during and interview situation.\", \"Federal laws include:\", \"Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (Title VII), which prohibits discrimination because of race, color, religion, national origin, and sex.  Title VII applies to employers with 15 or more employees. \", \"The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), which protects people age 40 or older from discrimination because of age.  The ADEA covers employers with 20 or more employees. \", \"The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), which makes it illegal to discriminate against qualified individuals with a disability.  The ADA applies to employers with 15 or more employees.\", \"The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), which prohibits employers from using and applicants or employee\\u2019s genetic information to discriminate against them in any respect.  GINA also covers employers with 15 or more employees.\", \"!IMPORTANT!\", \"Failure to abide by these equal employment laws can put the company at risk of a lawsuit and/or fines for discriminatory employment practices.  If discrimination is found the company may suffer both compensatory and punitive damages.  These damages can range from a limit of up to $50,000 for organizations with 15-100 employees to a limit of up to $300,000 for organizations with more than 500 employees.  Infinity falls into the category of over 500 employees.\", \"Most states and many municipalities have enacted similar laws, which may be more encompassing than those enforced on the federal level.  For those hiring you should become aware of all the applicable laws and review them before conducting any interviews.   \", \"ALL employment interviews must be conducted within the parameters of the law.  That is, the interviewer must not ask questions nor screen out candidates on the basis of characteristics protected by the law.  A failure to abide by these employment laws can result in allegations of discrimination and lawsuits, with serious consequences to the company.  \", \"How to Prepare for a Job Interview\", \"Hiring a new employee is a serious task, with potentially long-term benefits when a \\u201cgood\\u201d hire is made \\u2013 OR \\u2013 ramifications when a poor hire is made.  If a good hire is made, our company and the new employee will both benefit.  If, however, a bad hire is made \\u2013 one in which the employee lacks the necessary skills, knowledge, abilities, characteristics or competencies to succeed on the job \\u2013 the company suffers, through lost time and productivity needed to replace the mismatched hire as well as to find and train a new employee. As sports coaches say, \\u201cThe best defense is a good offense.\\u201d In the case of hiring, a \\u201cgood offense\\u201d is preparation.  Before going into an interview, you should take care to plan thoroughly for the job interview.\", \"Review and Update the Job Description\", \"You should work with the supervisors, human resources and any others to make sure the job description accurately reflects current and anticipated job duties, responsibilities, KSAs and competencies, and it also should identify essential job function \\u2013 those takes or responsibilities that are critical to the job (necessary to comply with the ADA).  \", \"TIP: When you update the job description, make it \\u201creal.\\u201d Go to the incumbent, watch the job being performed, and ask the incumbent to document what he or she does. \", \"Develop a Set of Standard Questions\", \"Interviewing, unfortunately, is never a completely objective process.  To remove as much subjectivity as possible, caused by a halo effect (bias influenced by first impressions, such as appearance, attractiveness, or education), stereotyping or even acquaintanceship, the person hiring should develop a list of standard interview questions designed to assess not only KSA\\u2019s but also the competencies required to do the job.\", \"These questions should be used in conjunction with a rating form, so that at the end of the interview process all candidates can be assessed objectively.  Questions should be phrased to require candidates to talk about their actual experiences (not to answer hypothetically).  Some suggested interview questions (with competencies indicated in parentheses) include:\", \"Tell me about yourself.  (Communication skills, business knowledge, job knowledge)\", \"In five minutes, walk me through your work history. (Communication skills, job knowledge)\", \"Why was your last job important to the company? (Job knowledge, business knowledge)\", \"Tell me about a problem you solved in your last job. (Problem solving, communication)\", \"Describe to me a time when you had to deal with an angry customer. (Customer relations, problem solving, communication)\", \"What were your department\\u2019s goals?  How did they relate to the company\\u2019s goals? (Business knowledge)\", \"Tell me about a time when you had a conflict with a co-worker or a supervisor and how you dealt with it. (Conflict resolution, problem solving, communication)\", \"What was the most satisfying part of your last job? (Job knowledge, motivation)\", \"What was the most frustrating part of your last job? (Job knowledge, motivation)\", \"Are you more detail-oriented or \\u201cbig-picture oriented\\u201d? Give me an example to illustrate.  (Detail orientation)\", \"Describe examples of projects you initiated on your own.  (Initiative)\", \"What kinds of things at work get you really excited about your job? (Initiative, communication, job knowledge)\", \"Describe a team experience you found rewarding.  Why? (Teamwork, communication)\", \"Describe a team experience you found frustrating.  Why?  (Teamwork, communication)\", \"What kinds of questions do you have about our company and the job? (Detail orientation, job knowledge, business knowledge, planning skills)\", \"Tell me why we should hire you. (Persuasion, communication, job knowledge, business knowledge)\", \"TIP: Rating the KSA\\u2019s of each candidate helps to make the hiring decision objective.  Create a rating sheet that lists each of the question, with KSAs and competencies it focuses on identifying.  Rate each answer and each KSA and competency using a scale of 1-5 with 5 being the best.  Compile ratings from everyone involved in the interview process to build consensus about the best candidate.  Save a master copy of the rating sheet for the next time the same job opens up.\", \"Questions to Avoid\", \"ALL QUESTIONS ASKED IN AN INTERVIEW SHOULD BE JOB-RELATED \\u2013NEVER PERSONAL.  Again, never personal.  The company is looking to hire based on the job not the individual's personal life.  You should never ask questions about an applicant's marital status or child care arrangements; age (other than \\u201cAre you over 18?\\u201d); religious affiliation and beliefs; ethnicity or national origin; disabilities; arrests; or other areas that might be construed as discriminatory.\", \"Some examples of questions to avoid, along with their alternatives, include:\", \"\", \"How to Structure a Job Interview\", \"An interview with a prospective employee is more than a casual conversation.  Before the applicant arrives, the interviewer should review the job description, all advertisements (in print and online) for the open position, and the applicant\\u2019s resume and job application.  When the applicant arrives, the interviewer should:\", \"Make an introduction, including his or her role in the hiring process as well as at work\", \"Outline the parameters of the interview, including the time allocation and that he or she will be taking notes\", \"Give an overview of the company as a whole (this will help the applicant relax)\", \"Describe the job and its qualifications and ask if the applicant has any question prior to beginning the interview\", \"Begin the interview, using the prepared list of questions and making notations on the rating sheet.\", \"End the interview with an explanation of the next steps the applicant can expect.\", \"Although the interviewer has a set of questions to ask and a time frame within which to conduct the interview, he or she should attempt to make the interview as conversation as possible.  The interviewer should encourage the applicant to ask questions as they occur.  The aim is to gather information that will allow an objective assessment of the applicant's fit into the organization and the job \\u2013 but not to interrogate and make the applicant uncomfortable.\", \"Did you know?  It pays to employ engaged employees.  In 2008 Towers Perrin Global Workplace Study found that businesses having a workforce of highly engaged employees outperformed their peers by as much as 28 percent.  The survey also found that companies whose employees are not highly engaged experienced a decline in operating income of more than 32 percent.  Results from this survey suggests that it pays off to make the time to find the right employees.\", \"\", \"How to Make a Hiring Decision\", \"All those involved in the interviewing process to find a potential candidate should compile the rating for all applicants interviewed.  Once all the interviews are completed and compiled, they should be compared.  The candidates with the highest rating should be considered for hire, assuming background checks and references support the interview results.\", \"TEST YOURSELF\", \"The best way to interview and make a hiring decision is on \\u201cgut\\u201d feeling \\u2013 that is, you just \\u201cknow\\u201d when you find the right person.\", \"True\", \"False\", \"An obviously pregnant woman applies for a job.  You are looking for a long-term employee.  Can you refuse to hire her because she is pregnant?\", \"Yes\", \"No\", \"Why should you avoid asking an applicant about arrest records?\", \"An arrest record does not mean a person has committed a crime\", \"Using arrest records to screen out candidates can limit opportunities of some protected groups therefore would be considered discrimination.\", \"Both A and B\", \"An applicant comes into a job interview wearing a gay-rights pin.  You know some of your employees have strong feelings about homosexuality.  You refuse to hire him because of his sexual orientation and keep harmony in your team.\", \"True\", \"False\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"Interviewing and Selecting Job Candidates: CALIFORNIA\", \"California is a great state and is extremely employee friendly!  California also has the strictest employment laws in all the United States.  Even if you are not hiring in California it is a good idea to follow the rules of California.\", \"Summary\", \"California antidiscrimination laws prohibit discrimination on the basis of protected characteristics of even the perception that someone is a member of a protected class.  (See: The Application Process)\", \"California law is more protective than federal law on the issue of disability discrimination.  For example, CA prohibits discriminating against a person based on a medical condition, which includes any health impairment that is related to or associated with a cancer diagnosis, a record or history of cancer, or one\\u2019s genetic characteristics. (See: Disability Issues)\", \"Private employers generally may ask about convictions (except for marijuana convictions over 2 years old), but not arrests (except for where the applicant is out on bail).  (See: Arrest and Conviction Records)\", \"Questions about criminal records that have been sealed or expunged are to be avoided during the hiring process.  (See: Expunged Criminal Records)\", \"State law prohibits most private employers from asking criminal history question until after making a conditional employment offer (See: Ban the Box)\", \"During interviews, employers should avoid overselling the job, should ask consistent questions and should avoid questions that relate to protected characteristics.  The California Department of Fair Housing and Employment provides a Fact Sheet with helpful guidance.  (See: Interviewing Applicants)\", \"California bans employers from relying on an applicant's salary history in determining what salary to offer or whether to offer employment.  (See: Salary History Inquiries)\", \"Employers must carefully check a candidate\\u2019s employment history, criminal history, and references to avoid potentially negligent hiring lawsuits, while still respecting the candidates constitutionally protected right to privacy.  (See: Selecting Candidates; Reference Checks)\", \"Employers may not request social media usernames and passwords of job applicants to access their personal social media websites.  (See: Social Media Laws)\", \"California bans discrimination against prospective employees based on their failure to designate male or female on a job application from.  (See: Transgender Identity and Expression)\", \"Localities including LA, RIchmond, and San Francisco have requirements pertaining to interviewing and selecting job candidates.  (See: Local Requirements)\", \"The Application Process\", \"California\\u2019s antidiscrimination laws, such as the Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA), prohibit discriminating against or refusing to hire an individual on the basis of the following protected characteristics:\", \"Age (40 and over)\", \"Genetic information\", \"Marital Status\", \"Medical condition (including cancer/genetic characteristics) or AIDS/HIV status\", \"Mental or physical disability\", \"National origin and ancestry, including language use\", \"Pregnancy\", \"Race and color\", \"Religion\", \"Sex (including gender identity or gender expression)\", \"Sexual orientation \", \"Veteran status\", \"FEHA not only prohibits adverse treatment against members of these protected classes, it also prohibits discrimination against those who are merely perceived to be members of a protected class.  Moreover, FEHA protects individuals who associate with people who have, or are perceived to have any protected characteristics.\", \"Example: Fred is a 38-year-old, heterosexual male. At his job interview with ABC Company, his interviewer informs him, \\u201cWell, Fred, you clearly have stellar credentials.  The problem is that we\\u2019re looking to move this company in a different, younger direction to better be able to keep up with the energy and ingenuity of our competitors.  What\\u2019s more, I am not sure you\\u2019re really the type of guy who would flourish in this office.  The guys here spend a lot of time talking about women and I am concerned you might feel left out.\\u201d\", \"Even through Fred is not in a protected class by way of his age or sexual orientation, because he is perceived as older and homosexual, he can file an age and sexual orientation discrimination charge.\", \"Employers should note, however, that FEHA is not an affirmative action measure.  As such individuals in the protected classes need not be given preference over those who do not carry any protected characteristics.\", \"Job Applications\", \"Employers recruiting employees in California should consider using a job application that takes into account state-specific requirements and/or state prohibitions with respect to the request of certain information. \", \"Job Advertisements\", \"Employers must protect themselves from liability for discrimination claims by ensuring all advertisements comply with state and federal laws.  For example, advertisements purporting to depict the employer's workforce should feature a broad spectrum of typical employees, including minorities, woman and individuals with disabilities.  A failure to do so may run afoul of any number of California statutes providing equal employment safeguards for protected classes.\", \"In addition, advertisements should not include language that might violate state and federal laws.  For example, an advertisement for a food server at a restaurant should avoid language like seeking young and energetic waitress.  Such ads could violate FEHA prohibitions against age and sex discrimination, in addition to federal law.  \", \"Disability Issues\", \"California provides broader protections to individuals with physical and mental disabilities than federal law.  For example, under the ADA, a person is deemed to be disabled if he or she is substantially limited in at least one major life activity, whereas under FEHA an individual need merely be limited in a major life activity.\", \"Further, in addition to prohibiting disability discrimination, California also prohibits discriminating against a person based on a medical condition, which includes any health impairment that is related to or associated with a cancer diagnosis, a record or history of chancer or ones genetic characteristics.  Thus, it is important that employers not consider these factors when interviewing and selecting job applicants.\", \"Much like the Americans with Disabilities Act, however, California\\u2019s FEHA does NOT prohibit employers from discriminating against an applicant or employee with a disability where the employee cannot perform the essential job functions even with a reasonable accommodation.  A job function may be essential where the position exists to perform the function, a limited number of employees are available to perform the function, or the function is highly specialized and the person in the position is hired for his or her expertise in that area.  \", \"Example: Katie has a severe stammer.  She applies with ABC Publishing to be a voice actor for the company\\u2019s book on tape.  However, Katie\\u2019s stammer prevents her from getting through complete sentences without stuttering.  Because the position exists for the purpose of having books read aloud and recorded, reading aloud is an essential function of the job, and ABC Publishing may refuse to hire her.\", \"As it is reasonable for an employer to identify that any applicant can meet essential job qualifications, an employer may ask questions that are narrowly tailored to learn such information.  For example, where being able to carry a 50-pound box is essential to the job, an employer may ask if an applicant has any physical limitations that would prevent him or her from carrying such weight.\", \"Nevertheless, California employers should always try to ensure that all qualified applicants, with or without a disability, have a good faith opportunity to compete for the job.\", \"Military Status\", \"California\\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act (FEHA) prohibits employment discrimination against a job applicant or employee because of his or her military or veteran status.  This law\\u2019s antidiscrimination protections extend to members or veterans of the US Armed Forces, US Armed Forces Reserve, the US National Guard and California National Guard.\", \"When the law permits, employers can still inquire about an applicant\\u2019s or employee\\u2019s military or veteran status when the request is made of the purpose of awarding a veteran\\u2019s preference (2013 Bill Text CA A.B. 556)\", \"Arrest and Conviction Records\", \"State law generally does not prohibit private employers from inquiring about an applicant\\u2019s criminal convictions after the initial job application stage.  However, California DOES prohibit employers from inquiring about convictions for most marijuana possession offenses more than two years old.\", \"In addition, employers cannot ask job applicants about an arrest not resulting in conviction unless the applicant is out on bail or his or her own recognizance pending trial.  Nor may an employer request that job applicants disclose information relating to participation or a referral to a criminal diversion program.  Employers may not seek prohibited information from sources other than the applicant either nor may they use such prohibited information as a factor in hiring decisions. \", \"It is advisable not to implement a policy where all applicants with a criminal record are automatically disqualified as this could violate state law if the convictions are not job related and the policy has a disparate impact on the protected class,  In addition, employers should be aware the state has issued regulations governing this area.\", \"Criminal History Regulations\", \"California regulations governing an employer\\u2019s ability to use criminal background information when making hiring decisions.  The regulations largely mirror the EEOC\\u2019s 2012 Enforcement Guidance in requiring an employer to show that any criminal history information sought is job-related and consistent with business necessity. \", \"Under the regulations, an employer may not consider the following types of criminal history when making hiring decisions:\", \"An arrest that did not result in conviction\", \"Participation in a pre-trial or post-trial diversion program\", \"Convictions that have been ordered sealed, expunged or eliminated by statute\", \"An arrest, detention or court disposition that occurred while a person was subject to a juvenile court \", \"A non-felony conviction for marijuana possession that is more than two years old\", \"Even if an employer can show that its policy or practice of considering conviction history is job-related and consistent with business necessity, applicants may still prevail if they can show that a less discriminatory policy or practice would serve the employers goals as effectively as the challenged policy without significantly increasing the cost or burden on the employer (2016 CA Regulation Text 23689).\", \"Expunged Criminal Records\", \"Private employers are prohibited from asking job applicants about expunged criminal convictions (i.e. records judicially dismissed or ordered sealed).

There are limited exceptions for positions in law enforcements, health care facilities or other areas where the specifically prohibits the employment of individuals convicted of certain offenses.\", \"Criminal History Inquiry Amendments\", \"California amended its criminal history law to clarify how employers my screen applicants using information about expunged or judicially sealed convictions.\", \"An employer may ask an applicant about a particular conviction if any of the following situation apply:\", \"The employer is required by law to obtain information about the applicant\\u2019s particular conviction, even if that conviction has been expunged or judicially sealed.\", \"The applicant is requested to possess or use a firearm during his or her employment\", \"The law prohibits an individual with that particular conviction from holding the job sought by the applicants\", \"The employer is prohibited by law from hiring applicant who has that particular conviction.\", \"(2017 Bill Text CA S.B. 1412)\", \"Ban the Box Law\", \"\", \"\"]"
