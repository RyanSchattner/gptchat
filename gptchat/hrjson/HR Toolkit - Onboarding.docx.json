In basic terms, onboarding is the process of getting new hires acclimated to their new roles. It includes setting clear guidelines for performance and company culture, and sharing the knowledge necessary for success within an organization. \", \"Onboarding takes training and orientation to the next level. Unlike traditional employee orientation, onboarding is a systematic process that extends well beyond the first day of employment. The goal of the process is to cultivate a long-term relationship between the employer and the employee while fostering a feeling of belonging and of making the right career choice. \", \"Every business is different, so there is no universal way to handle the onboarding process of new hires. However, the tips in this toolkit can help you improve your process in a way that works best for your organization. This toolkit is intended to provide tips to enhance the onboarding process\\u2014employers still need to comply with all laws and fill out all traditional paperwork. For additional help, contact Prospero Benefits & Insurance Services, Inc.. \", \"The Importance of Onboarding\", \"Why is onboarding so important? The answer is simple: this is the first chance to show new employees why you do what you do and to set them up for success within your company culture. Onboarding helps develop your brand and can build a positive reputation for your company among talented job seekers. \", \"A study of 264 new employees, published in the Academy of Management Journal, found that the first 90 days of employment (often called the probationary period) is pivotal for building rapport with the company, management and co-workers. Furthermore, according to a study by the Wynhurst Group, when employees go through structured onboarding, they are 58 percent more likely to remain with the organization after three years. When you share your company\\u2019s goals and values with your employees while simultaneously showing them how to do their jobs, everyone benefits. \", \"Moreover, employers who do not take onboarding seriously risk losing the new employees they spent so long trying to get in the door. In fact, the average company loses 17 percent of their new hires during the first three months, according to the Harvard Business Review. The importance of the first 90 days cannot be overstated. Use the resources in this toolkit to strengthen your onboarding program and retain your talent. Ignoring this process now can lead to consequences in the future.\", \"\\nSet the Foundation Early\", \"Simply offering training courses to new hires will not be sufficient for onboarding. You must consider all the smaller aspects that create an efficient and painless transition into the company. This means working with stakeholders well before new hires start. Establishing a strong onboarding foundation prior to day one is key for long-term success. This section discusses some tips for doing just that.\", \"Be Realistic About Job Descriptions\", \"Give new hires realistic previews of their jobs and make sure the descriptions are as honest as possible. Doing so will guarantee that you and the new hires are on the same page and have the same job expectations. This can help retain new employees, since confusion or uncertainty can cause new hires to quit soon after starting. Ensuring new employees understand their positions in advance helps reduce the chance of them feeling ill-equipped when learning their new roles. Surprise about their responsibilities is the last thing your new hires should feel on their first day. \", \"Preboard New Hires  \", \"Everyone remembers how stressful the first day of a job can be. Help alleviate some of that stress by preboarding. This process involves sending new hires any information they may find useful in advance of day one. Sending the following information beforehand can help reduce new employees\\u2019 stress and prepare them for a busy first day:\", \"A welcome letter or email \", \"Information about the company and the industry\", \"Helpful first-day resources, including a schedule and information about who their manager or mentor will be\", \"Essential HR and tax forms \", \"\", \"\", \"Formalize the Onboarding Process\", \"Make sure the onboarding process is formalized, including your training and orientation. This does not mean the process has to be boring\\u2014merely that training should not be adlibbed by staff at the last minute when the new hires arrive. A formalized onboarding process can go on for days, weeks or even months. Make the most of this opportunity and get new hires up to speed on everything going on within the organization. Explain the company\\u2019s structure, its place in the industry and its management hierarchy. Above all, make sure new hires are getting the same training as everyone else in their departments. Formalizing the onboarding process will ease the tensions of starting in new roles.\", \"Include Everyone\", \"When deciding whom to include in the onboarding process, do not just think about the people who are involved in the new hires\\u2019 day-to-day operations. Include other stakeholders like HR managers, executives and anyone else who may be important in the company as a whole. Have these people introduce themselves, along with their roles, and encourage them to extend an open line of communication. Do not be afraid to introduce the new hires to important clients either. Doing so can help new employees by providing a glimpse of whom they will be working with on a regular basis\\u2014plus, it reassures clients that they will continue to be taken care of. \", \"Recruit a Mentor\", \"Assigning mentors to new hires can be invaluable to the onboarding process. Sun Microsystems conducted a study that looked at data from more than 1,000 of its employees over a five-year period and found that its mentoring program had positively benefitted everyone involved. According to the study, 25 percent of employees who participated in the test group had a salary grade change, compared to the 5 percent who did not participate. \", \"Additionally, mentors were promoted six times more often and mentees were promoted five times more often than those not in the program. Retention rates were also higher\\u201469 percent for mentors and 72 percent for mentees, compared to a 49 percent retention rate for employees who did not participate in the program.   \", \"Mentors can help new hires in a variety of ways, including the following:\", \"Give new hires a better understanding of the workplace by offering a different point of view.\", \"Act as a safe source for questions, since new hires might not feel comfortable asking their managers certain things.\", \"Reassure new hires that they are not alone and that there are contacts besides HR and their managers who can answer everyday questions.\", \"Help new hires learn the organization\\u2019s culture more quickly so they can be as productive as possible.\", \"New hires are not the only ones who can gain from the mentoring experience. Offering the chance to advise others can increase a mentor\\u2019s confidence and overall job satisfaction. Organizations that provide mentoring support show that they care about their employees and that they are invested in them long term. Additionally, it displays confidence in the mentor to groom new employees for success.\", \"\", \"\\nFollow-through with New Hires\", \"Remember, onboarding does not happen overnight. It takes dedication and follow-through from both the new hires and whomever is guiding them. An easy pitfall to slip into is leaving new hires to their own devices during the onboarding period, perhaps to review training materials. Try to avoid isolating new employees, and instead encourage them to talk with others and establish contacts who can help them with questions during their onboarding. This section details some of the ways you can help foster a productive onboarding process for new employees while keeping them engaged throughout it. \", \"Make Onboarding Exciting\", \"Benjamin Franklin once said, \\u201cTell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn.\\u201d While new hires are going through training and orientation, incorporate activities that liven up the process and make them feel involved. Sitting through a series of training lectures makes for a very long day and new hires are likely to feel burned out after a while. Consider the following activities to help jazz up your training program:\", \"Have trainees guess company statistics, like how many customers are served each day or the number of products produced in a month.\", \"Facilitate a \\u201cJeopardy\\u201d game where the questions are related to the subject being taught.\", \"Quiz new hires on the subject matter of a training session to encourage active listening and participation. \", \"Hold \\u201cmocks\\u201d where new hires pretend they are doing an essential job function, like interacting with an upset customer, assembling a product or creating detailed spreadsheets.\", \"Require new hires to give a short presentation on what they learned in a given week (or after training ends). Use this to gauge if individuals require more guidance before starting full time in their role.\", \"Using engaging and fun activities at the beginning of the onboarding process can create positive energy in the workplace that promotes team building and improves productivity. For example, a game such as a scavenger hunt can be used to teach new employees how to understand and process large amounts of information, such as an employee handbook. After discussing the handbook at a high level, see who can find the answers to the most handbook-related questions in a given amount of time. Consider giving a small reward to the winners. It could be something small like a trophy for their desks, or something bigger, like a gift card. Get creative. \", \"Here are other ideas for making onboarding fun:\", \"Decorate the new hires\\u2019 desks before their first day and prepare a welcome note or card. \", \"Prepare some company \\u201cswag\\u201d for them. Whether it is branded clothing, coffee mugs or pens with the company logo, receiving something from the company makes new employees feel like they are already members of the team. \", \"Consider having the new hires\\u2019 teams take them to lunch during the first week, or have lunch catered for the team. This supports a more relaxed environment and allows the new hires to get to know everyone a little better. \", \"In short, show that the company is not just going through an administrative hiring process\\u2014new hires were chosen for a reason, and the company acknowledges the value that they will bring to the organization. Make new hires proud to be working for you by showing your appreciation for them. \", \"Establish Management Expectations\", \"It is important that managers contact new hires on day one and make sure they have an open conversation about their roles in the department and in the company as a whole. This would be a good time to give a tour, introduce them to other team members, establish a mentor and reiterate the company\\u2019s cultural expectations. \", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"Managers should share department goals and the method for tracking these goals early on. It also reinforces the fact that new hires are part of a larger team, working toward greater company goals.  \", \"Apart from the department and company goals, managers must also lay out clear guidelines for new hire success. This can look different depending on the organization, but it typically includes communicating team expectations, identifying personal responsibilities and having a clear path for the onboarding process. Essentially, new hires should not have to guess what their managers are expecting from them. Establishing expectations early on will help new hires understand their place in the organization.\", \"\\nTake Advantage of Technology\", \"Incorporating the right types of technology during the onboarding process can make the first weeks of employment more enjoyable and productive while also laying the groundwork for new employees\\u2019 success. Since technology is nearly inescapable nowadays, offering innovative programs during onboarding can help to familiarize new hires with the day-to-day systems that your organization uses. The following are some ways you can use technology in your onboarding program.\", \"Intranet Site\", \"Many organizations have an internal website (or intranet site) specifically for employees to access important company information. Unfortunately, employees do not always find these sites useful or engaging. Consider using an intranet site and stocking it with resources you know new hires will need. Examples include an employee handbook, training schedules, an employee directory and links to industry websites. During onboarding, be sure to demonstrate this site and ask new employees to explore it.\", \"Prerecord Trainings\", \"Training via live or prerecorded video for those in remote locations, instead of paying for travel costs, is another way of using technology to your advantage. Consider pairing prerecorded sessions with software that can quiz and track trainees\\u2019 progress online. Having remote learning opportunities like this can make scheduling much easier and allows new hires to learn at their own pace. This is especially important to consider when you have Generation Z individuals entering the workforce (those born between 1995 and 2010), since they are accustomed to getting the majority of information via technology. \", \"Company Networking Platform\", \"There is a growing need for companies to think about social networking. Platforms like Yammer and Chatter provide resources for employees to build meaningful connections within the organization. These platforms act similarly to social media sites, like Facebook, but they are protected behind your company\\u2019s firewall and only accessible by your employees. This can be a great way to engage with employees in a more casual way, which can be welcoming for new hires.\", \"Think Outside the Box\", \"Do not be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to onboarding. Remember, the process is about integrating new hires into your company culture and helping them transition into their new roles. A formalized process that offers a variety of useful information is integral, but trying different things can be useful too. In fact, offering a variety of teaching methods and platforms can actually increase the success of your program. Keep in mind that you can extend onboarding for as long as you deem necessary. Some onboarding programs continue for months. Determine what success looks like for new hires at your company and tailor your onboarding process to achieve that goal.\", \"\\nRetaining New Hires with Career Pathing\", \"Your goal as a company should be retaining the talented individuals you spent a significant amount of time and money recruiting. A recruiter\\u2019s worst nightmare is having new hires leave after a few months. With this in mind, it is paramount that you define clear paths for new hires within the organization. Let them know where their position can lead if they stay with the company, or what career opportunities there are in other departments. The key is to keep them even if they decide the roles they were hired for do not align with their ultimate career goals. \", \"If new hires are not acclimating well to their new position, do not give up without a fight. Help plot a course for internal career development opportunities that align better with the new hire\\u2019s interests. Let new employees know that they have a future with the company. Explain how individuals in similar roles have moved across departments and found success. You spent a lot of time recruiting and onboarding these individuals, so you must do everything you can to keep them and not waste those resources. Contact Prospero Benefits & Insurance Services, Inc. for more information regarding career pathing. \", \"Engage Early and Often\", \"According to Gallup, only 30 percent of the U.S. workforce feels engaged in their work. The rest are either not engaged, or, even worse, actively disengaged. Employees who are not engaged show a lack of enthusiasm and are less committed to their workplaces. Actively disengaged employees are more likely to steal from their employers, negatively influence their co-workers, miss workdays and drive customers away. Disengaged employees cost the United States an average of $500 billion each year in lost productivity. This illustrates how important engagement during the onboarding process can be.\", \"To feel engaged, new hires must understand that what they will be doing matters to the company and that their performance will make a difference. Illustrate the impact of new employees\\u2019 roles in the company by encouraging your workforce to own their work and to take pride in what they do. You should be engaging with new hires and stressing these points throughout the onboarding process.\", \"An employee engagement survey is a great starting place for addressing this issue. Many consulting firms offer such surveys, but you can also create and conduct one on your own. They typically gauge opinions on management, direct supervisors, co-workers, employer-employee communication, opportunities for advancement, job characteristics and HR policies. Consider asking new employees to complete the survey after 90 days of employment, once they have a chance to form opinions. \", \"By identifying areas that are hindering employee engagement, your company can focus on improving those areas so it can move toward a more engaged, productive and profitable workforce. Engaging early and often in the onboarding process can get new hires accustomed to having dialogues with their managers. This open communication can pay off hugely and help encourage employees to speak up when they have concerns. If engagement is ignored during onboarding, employees may be less likely to speak up down the road. \", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"Evaluate the Process\", \"\", \"\", \"\\nUse Checklists to Stay on Top \", \"Keeping track of new hires\\u2019 onboarding progress can be overwhelming for even the most seasoned HR team. Consider utilizing a simple checklist to navigate the onboarding process in a way that creates a welcoming atmosphere and a long-term relationship. The checklist on the next page can be used as a starting point for you to customize according to your own needs, whether it is for a hiring manager, manager or mentor. \", \"Onboarding Checklist\", \"BEFORE THE EMPLOYEE\\u2019S START DATE\", \"Job Duties and Schedule\", \"Contact the employee with useful information that may include any of the following: \", \"Confirmation of the start date, time, place, parking, maps and dress code \", \"Name of his or her mentor, if applicable\", \"Request to complete new-hire paperwork, such as tax forms, direct deposit form and emergency contact information\", \"Add regularly scheduled meetings to the employee\\u2019s calendar.\", \"Plan the employee\\u2019s first assignments.\", \"Social\", \"Email the employee\\u2019s department with relevant information about their new team member, such as his or her start date, role and a brief bio.

Include the mentor and any relevant team members.\", \"Work Environment\", \"Give the employee a key or building access card.\", \"Take the employee on a building tour. \", \"Explain how to get additional supplies. \", \"Technology \", \"Provide information on setting up voicemail and computer. \", \"FIRST WEEK\", \"Job Duties and Schedule\", \"Give the employee his or her initial assignment\\u2014something small and doable.\", \"Briefly check in with employee each day to address any questions or concerns that may arise. \", \"Explain the annual performance review and goal-setting process.\", \"Review the process related to the probationary period, if applicable. \", \"FIRST 3 MONTHS\", \"Job Duties and Schedule\", \"Conduct regularly occurring one-on-one meetings while giving timely, useful feedback.\", \"Meet for informal three-month performance check-in. \", \"Create written performance goals and professional development goals.  \", \"Social \", \"Meet with the employee\\u2019s mentor to review initial stages of mentorship and answer questions. \", \"\", \"Training and Development\", \"Ensure the employee has attended all scheduled training and is signed up for any future training sessions that may be needed. \", \"Provide information about continued learning opportunities, if applicable.\", \"FIRST 6 MONTHS\", \"Job Duties and Schedule\", \"Conduct six-month performance review. \", \"Review progress on performance goals and professional development goals.\", \"FIRST YEAR (BETWEEN 6 AND 12 MONTHS)\", \"Job Duties and Schedule\", \"Celebrate successes and recognition of the employee\\u2019s contributions. \", \"Continue providing regular informal feedback; provide formal feedback during the annual review process.\", \"Have a conversation with the employee about his or her experience to date.\", \"Discuss potential goals for the next year. \", \"Training and Development\", \"Discuss the employee\\u2019s professional development goals and identify relevant learning opportunities. \", \"\\nUse Surveys for Benchmarking \", \"Part of a successful onboarding process involves listening to employee feedback and using that feedback to make changes as needed. Consider asking each employee to complete a short survey after 90 days of employment\\u2014when he or she has finished the onboarding process and has had time to become acclimated to his or her job, yet still remembers specifics about the experience.\", \"Deciding whether to keep the survey responses anonymous depends on what you expect from the survey\\u2019s results. It is sometimes difficult to make necessary onboarding changes when you don\\u2019t know the details surrounding anonymous survey responses. However, you are more likely to get honest answers this way. Companies like SurveyMonkey\\u2014whose website allows you customize and distribute surveys directly through its servers\\u2014are popular choices for employers who choose to keep employee responses anonymous. Another route is to directly email a survey to each employee, expecting complete transparency so that you can more easily adjust your processes. \", \"Some examples of onboarding survey questions include the following:\", \"Hiring Process\", \"Was the job description clear and understandable?\", \"Was the HR contact professional and knowledgeable during the hiring process?\", \"Was the length of time between the submission of your application and the employer\\u2019s response reasonable?\", \"Was the length of time between the submission of your application and the job offer reasonable?\", \"Are you satisfied with the hiring process overall?\", \"Branding\", \"Before applying for this job, were you familiar with the company?\", \"Were you sent information before the first day that helped you know what to expect before reporting to work?\", \"During your onboarding session, were you provided with concise information regarding the following:\", \"The company\\u2019s mission\", \"Your role in the department and the company\", \"The organizational structure\", \"First Day\", \"Was your team ready for your arrival?\", \"Were you welcomed by your manager and introduced to your team?\", \"Was your workstation or office fully equipped with the necessary hardware and software?\", \"Was the information you received about employee benefits clear and helpful?\", \"Was the information you received about personnel policies clear and helpful?\", \"Did you know who to contact regarding specific questions after your first day?\", \"First Month\", \"Were you assigned proper training during your first month?\", \"Did you know what was expected of you during your first month?\", \"Did you know where to get the answers to your questions?\", \"Was the performance management system explained to you?\", \"First 90 Days\", \"Did you receive ongoing feedback from your supervisor about your performance?\", \"Is the work you are doing now consistent with what was described in the job posting and during the interview process?\", \"Are you satisfied with the overall orientation that you received?\", \"General Onboarding Process Questions\", \"What was your motivation for choosing and accepting this position?\", \"Do you have any recommendations for improving our recruitment, hiring or onboarding processes?\", \"Is there any additional feedback that you can share?\", \"\\nSummary\", \"Onboarding employees the right way can improve retention and save money, while building upon your company\\u2019s culture and brand.
