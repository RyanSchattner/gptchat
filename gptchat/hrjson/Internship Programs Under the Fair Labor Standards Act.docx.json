"[\"\", \"Internship Programs Under The Fair Labor Standards Act\", \"Brought to you by Prospero Benefits & Insurance Services, Inc.\", \"This fact sheet provides general information to help determine whether interns and students working for \\u201cfor-profit\\u201d employers are entitled to minimum wages and overtime pay under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).1\", \"Background\\nThe FLSA requires \\u201cfor-profit\\u201d employers to pay employees for their work. Interns and students, however, may not be \\u201cemployees\\u201d under the FLSA\\u2014in which case the FLSA does not require compensation for their work.\", \"The Test for Unpaid Interns and Students\\nCourts have used the \\u201cprimary beneficiary test\\u201d to determine whether an intern or student is, in fact, an employee under the FLSA.2\\u00a0In short, this test allows courts to examine the \\u201ceconomic reality\\u201d of the intern-employer relationship to determine which party is the \\u201cprimary beneficiary\\u201d of the relationship. Courts have identified the following seven factors as part of the test:\", \"The extent to which the intern and the employer clearly understand that there is no expectation of compensation. Any promise of compensation, express or implied, suggests that the intern is an employee\\u2014and vice versa.\", \"The extent to which the internship provides training that would be similar to that which would be given in an educational environment, including the clinical and other hands-on training provided by educational institutions.\", \"The extent to which the internship is tied to the intern\\u2019s formal education program by integrated coursework or the receipt of academic credit.\", \"The extent to which the internship accommodates the intern\\u2019s academic commitments by corresponding to the academic calendar.\", \"The extent to which the internship\\u2019s duration is limited to the period in which the internship provides the intern with beneficial learning.\", \"The extent to which the intern\\u2019s work complements, rather than displaces, the work of paid employees while providing significant educational benefits to the intern.\", \"The extent to which the intern and the employer understand that the internship is conducted without entitlement to a paid job at the conclusion of the internship.\", \"Courts have described the \\u201cprimary beneficiary test\\u201d as a flexible test, and no single factor is determinative. Accordingly, whether an intern or student is an employee under the FLSA necessarily depends on the unique circumstances of each case.\", \"If analysis of these circumstances reveals that an intern or student is actually an employee, then he or she is entitled to both minimum wage and overtime pay under the FLSA. On the other hand, if the analysis confirms that the intern or student is not an employee, then he or she is not entitled to either minimum wage or overtime pay under the FLSA.\", \"Where to Obtain Additional Information\\nThis publication is for general information and is not a regulation.

WHD also recognizes an exception for individuals who volunteer their time, freely and without anticipation of compensation, for religious, charitable, civic, or humanitarian purposes to non-profit organizations. Unpaid internships for public sector and non-profit charitable organizations, where the intern volunteers without expectation of compensation, are generally permissible.\", \"2\\u00a0-\\u00a0E.g., Benjamin v.
