"[\"FAQs on the Delinquent Filer Voluntary Correction Program\", \"The Delinquent Filer Voluntary Correction Program (DFVCP) is a Department of Labor (DOL) program designed to encourage voluntary compliance with ERISA\\u2019s annual reporting requirements. ERISA\\u2019s annual reporting requirement is commonly referred to as the Form 5500.\", \"In general, employers that are subject to ERISA must file a Form 5500 with the DOL for their employee benefit plans each year, unless an exemption applies. The Form 5500 must generally be filed by the last day of the seventh month following the end of the plan year, unless the employer requests an extension. The DOL has the authority to assess penalties for noncompliance with the Form 5500 filing requirement, including not filing Form 5500 by the due date.\", \"The DFVCP gives delinquent plan administrators a way to avoid potentially higher civil penalty assessments by voluntarily filing late Forms 5500 and paying reduced penalties. To help plan administrators use the DFVCP, the DOL has issued frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the program. This Compliance Overview contains the DOL\\u2019s FAQs on the DFVCP.\", \"Q1: What is the DFVCP?\", \"In an effort to encourage pension and welfare plan administrators to file overdue annual reports (commonly referred to as the Form 5500), the DOL\\u2019s Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) provides plan administrators with the opportunity to pay reduced civil penalties for voluntarily complying with the annual reporting requirements.\", \"Q2: Who is eligible to participate in the DFVCP?\", \"Plan administrators are eligible to pay reduced civil penalties under the program if the required filings under the DFVCP are made prior to the date on which the administrator is notified in writing by the DOL of a failure to file a timely annual report under Title I of ERISA.\", \"Q3: How does a plan administrator file a delinquent Form 5500 or Form 5500-SF (for eligible small plans) under the DFVCP?\", \"Participation in the DFVCP is a two-step process: \", \"Important: The DOL strongly recommends you electronically submit your payment to the DFVCP. This will help you avoid making costly errors calculating the payments due the DFVCP. \", \"You may also make your payment by check by printing out and mailing a paper copy of the electronically completed and filed Form 5500 or Form 5500-SF, without schedules or attachments, and a penalty check made to the DOL for the applicable penalty amount (described below). \\t\", \"DFVCP\", \"P.O.

The DOL encourages you to use this calculator so you can avoid any errors that could delay your participation on the program. \", \"Q5: If not submitting a payment electronically, to whom should the check be made payable?\", \"The penalty check should be made payable to the Department of Labor.\", \"Q6: Is participation under the DFVCP available to all Form 5500 Series filers?\", \"No. The relief under the DFVCP is available only to the extent that a Form 5500 is required to be filed under Title I of ERISA. If annual reporting for a plan is only required under the Internal Revenue Code, it is not eligible for penalty relief under DFVCP. However, IRS penalties may still apply. For example, plans covering only self-employed individuals, sole owners (and their spouses) or partners (and their spouses) are not subject to Title I of ERISA. Such plans electing to file Form 5500-SF with EFAST2 instead of filing the Form 5500-EZ with the IRS are not eligible to participate in the DFVCP program.\", \"Q7: Which version of the Form 5500 should be filed?\", \"Generally, the filer should file using the correct year form that is delinquent. However, there are exceptions. The DOL has available on its website at www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa an online tool to help delinquent filers determine which versions of Forms 5500/5500-SF and schedules to use. Filers simply enter very limited information as prompted (such as the beginning date of the plan year for which the late filings are made) and the tool identifies the correct versions of the Forms 5500/5500-SF to use.\", \"FAQ 4 of the Frequently Asked Questions on the EFAST2 Electronic Filing System explains how to submit a delinquent Form 5500 electronically to EFAST2 for plan years prior to 2009.\", \"Caution: Do not include a Schedule SSA or IRS Form 8955-SSA (information on separated, deferred vested participants) in an electronic filing with EFAST2.

If during that period, the plan\\u2019s classification has shifted between being a large and small plan, which penalty cap applies to the plan\\u2019s DFVCP submission?\", \"If, during the years of non-filing, there is at least one year where the plan is a large plan, for purposes of the DFVCP, the plan must use the large plan penalty amounts of $10 per day up to a maximum of $2,000 per filing, not to exceed $4,000 per plan.\", \"Q10: Is there a different per-plan penalty cap that applies to administrators of small plans sponsored by Internal Revenue Code (Code) Section 501(c)(3) organizations (including Code Section 403(b) small plans)?\", \"Yes. In the case of a small plan sponsored by a Code Section 501(c)(3) organization (including a Code Section 403(b) small plan required to file an annual report), the applicable penalty amount is $10 per day for each day the annual report is filed after the date on which the annual report was due (without regard to any extensions), not to exceed $750 regardless of the number of delinquent annual reports for the plan submitted as part of the same DFVCP submission. \", \"This per-plan penalty cap, however, will not be available if, as of the date the plan files under the DFVCP, there is a delinquent or late annual report due for a plan year during which the plan was a large plan, in which case the large plan cap will apply.\", \"If you are using the online penalty calculator or choose to submit to the program electronically, you must answer \\u201cYes\\u201d on the calculator to the question, \\u201cAre you a 501(c)(3) organization?\\u201d If you are paying by mail you must include the notation \\u201c501(c)(3) Organization\\u201d in the upper-right corner of the first page of the paper print-out of the electronically filed Form 5500 or Form 5500-SF that must be mailed to the DFVCP, along with the penalty check.\", \"Q11: Are extensions considered when calculating penalties under the DFVCP?\", \"No. All penalties under the DFVCP are calculated at $10 per day, beginning on the day after the date the filing was due, without regard to any extensions.\", \"\", \"Q12: May plans participate in the DFVCP if they have already received correspondence from the DOL or the IRS?\", \"Plan administrators are eligible to pay reduced civil penalties under the program if the required filings under the DFVCP are made prior to the date on which the administrator is notified in writing by the DOL of a failure to file a timely annual report under Title I of ERISA. \", \"An IRS late-filer letter will not disqualify a plan from participating in the DFVCP. A DOL Notice of Intent to Assess a Penalty will always disqualify a plan.\", \"Q13: Does a plan administrator waive any rights upon filing under the DFVCP?\", \"Yes. Payment of the penalty amount under the terms of the DFVCP constitutes, with regard to the filings submitted under the program, a waiver of the right both to receive notice of the penalty assessment from the DOL and to contest the DOL\\u2019s assessment of the DFVCP penalty amount.\", \"Q14: If a filing has been made under the DFVCP, will the plan administrator be liable for any other DOL annual reporting civil penalties?\", \"Annual reports that are filed under the DFVCP are subject to the usual edit checks and other enforcement reviews. Plan administrators generally will have an opportunity to correct deficiencies in accordance with the procedures described in 29 CFR \\u00a7 2560.502c-2. The failure to correct deficiencies in accordance with these procedures may result in the assessment of further deficient filer penalties.\", \"Q15: Can plan assets be used to pay the civil penalties assessed under ERISA \\u00a7 502(c)(2)?\", \"No. The plan administrator is personally liable for the payment of civil penalties assessed under ERISA \\u00a7 502(c)(2). Civil penalties, including penalties paid under the DFVCP, cannot be paid from the assets of an employee benefit plan.\", \"Q16: May an administrator of an apprenticeship and training plan, as described in 29 CFR \\u00a7 2520.104-22, or an administrator of a top hat plan, as described in 29 CFR \\u00a7 2520.104-23, participate in the DFVCP?\", \"Yes.

The Form 5500 filed by these DFEs is an integral part of the annual report of the participating employee benefit plans. If a Form 5500 was timely filed for the participating employee benefit plans, a failure to timely file a DFE Form 5500 for these entities may cause the plan\\u2019s annual report to be incomplete or inaccurate, but it does not result in the plan being a late or non-filer. The plan\\u2019s Form 5500, however, may be subject to rejection for being incomplete or inaccurate, and, if rejected, a plan administrator who failed to correct the problem would be subject to penalty assessments by the DOL.\", \"A Form 5500 filed for a group insurance arrangement (GIA) under the DOL\\u2019s regulations relieves the plan administrators of the individual plans participating in the GIA from the requirement to file a separate Form 5500/Form 5500-SF for each plan. The DOL will allow a GIA that failed to file a GIA Form 5500 on time to use the DFVCP to correct the late filing.
