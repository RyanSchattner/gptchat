"[\"Corporate Communication and Social Media                        \", \"As social media sites continue to grow in popularity, more companies are looking for ways to engage with consumers on these platforms. Including social media in your company\\u2019s corporate communication strategy can be beneficial for the following reasons: \", \"You can reach a broader audience. Posting on social media can help spread the word about your company much further and more quickly.\", \"You can target audiences for certain types of communications. For example, if many customers follow you on Twitter, but you don\\u2019t want to send an email for every corporate announcement, tweet your news instead.\", \"You can communicate news in a personal way. Social media can help you develop your brand and strengthen customer relationships. Rather than simply seeing a press release or news story, your audience can hear the news straight from you, in your own words.\", \"You can monitor the response to news and events, good and bad. If you\\u2019re not on social media, then you\\u2019re likely not privy to what is being said about your company. Keeping a tab on what the public is saying about your company can help you identify areas for improvement and recognize areas of success.\", \"Get Employees Involved\", \"In addition to using your company\\u2019s social media accounts to share corporate news, it may also be beneficial to have employees share their expert knowledge on these platforms. For example, if you have a company blog, consider asking employees who are experts in their department or product to contribute or write blog posts. This can add more personality and voice to your company and products, plus additional expertise for your audience. Involving employees in blogs can be especially valuable if your company encompasses multiple product lines or branches, since each blog can speak to a specific audience.\", \"However, remember to position these employees as subject-matter experts sharing valuable information, not just employees pushing products. Blog posts can share company or product information, but only as a subset of their bigger purpose\\u2014whether that is to inform or entertain your consumers.\", \"\", \"\", \"Twitter and Facebook are also viable corporate communication platforms. But, as with any social media strategy, make sure you aren\\u2019t simply promoting the company. It\\u2019s great to share company news and information, but that should only be a portion of your content. \", \"Whether via blogging, Facebook, Twitter, or another social media site, encourage your employee experts to find and share information that is relevant and meaningful to their unique audiences\\u2014beyond company news and product-related information. The goal is for the employee to become a trusted expert in his or her niche and to build a following. This connection can help develop closer relationships with customers and grow your brand.\", \"Protect your Company \", \"As with any social media business initiative, it\\u2019s important to protect your company. This is even more vital if you have employees blogging, tweeting and posting on behalf of your company. Therefore, before implementing a new social media strategy, create a comprehensive policy for employees so that all expectations are clear.\", \"For instance, will employees use work or personal accounts for their blogging or tweeting? There are implications for both types of account. Personal accounts can seem more relatable and personable, which could help attract and retain more followers. On the other hand, any followers employees gain while working at your company will likely leave with them if they leave the company. \", \"If you allow employees to use personal accounts to also post work information, consider setting guidelines about the type of personal things that can be shared\\u2014once this person represents your company, anything they say can reflect on your brand. Be sure to establish other clear guidelines, such as what constitutes acceptable or unacceptable social media behavior. \", \"After you have a policy developed, distribute it to all employees and have them sign a form stating that they have read and understand the policy. This will help protect your company from potential legal liabilities in the future.\", \"Sample Tweets or Facebook\\u00ae Posts\", \"While the content you create will vary based on your business goals, below are some sample social media posts:\", \"#INFINITY ENERGY INC. is proud to announce the #acquisition of XYZ Company! Read all about it at INFINITY ENERGY INC..blogspot.com.\", \"Jane Smith, VP of #marketing at INFINITY ENERGY INC., will speak at the #2016smallbusinessmarketingconference. Come check it out!\", \"Congrats to Joe Johnson who recently won the #excellencyaward for his outstanding work on INFINITY ENERGY INC.\\u2019s #communityoutreach project!\", \"In Summary\", \"Social media allows companies the opportunity to reach a wider audience in a more convenient, timely manner. Before rolling out a social media strategy, though, it is important to consider which employees will be involved in external communication efforts and to develop a clear policy regarding social media usage to ensure your brand\\u2019s reputation is protected.\"]"
