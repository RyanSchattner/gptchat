"[\"Employers have the option of contracting with a third-party administrator to administer their Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) obligations; that third party is referred to as the plan administrator. The employer is required to notify the plan administrator in the event of any of the following:\", \"Employee\\u2019s death\", \"Employee\\u2019s termination of employment (other than by reason of gross misconduct)\", \"Employee\\u2019s reduction in hours\", \"Employee becoming entitled to Medicare\", \"Employer filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy\", \"Employers are required to notify the plan administrator within 30 days of an employee experiencing a qualifying event. However, if the employer uses the delayed notice rule, where the COBRA maximum coverage period begins on the date of the loss of coverage, the employer must then notify the plan administrator within 30 days of a loss of coverage due to the qualifying event.\", \"A special rule applicable to multi-employer plans allows for a longer period of time within which the employer must provide the plan administrator with notice. These plans may choose uniform time limits for a qualifying event notice (or election notice) or have the plan administrator determine when a qualifying event occurred. Any special rules must be set out in the governing plan documents.\", \"The employer\\u2019s notice must provide sufficient information to enable the plan administrator to determine the following:\", \"Plan name\", \"Covered employee\", \"Type of qualifying event\", \"Date of the qualifying event (including date of loss of coverage)\", \"\", \"\"]"
