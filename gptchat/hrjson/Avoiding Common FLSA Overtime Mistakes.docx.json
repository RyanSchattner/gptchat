"[\"Avoiding Common FLSA Overtime Mistakes\", \"The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to pay nonexempt employees with overtime pay for every hour they work over 40 during a workweek. Overtime pay must be paid at a rate of one and one-half the employee\\u2019s regular rate of pay. \", \"An employee\\u2019s regular rate of pay is the average compensation an employee receives for every hour he or she worked during a workweek. To calculate an employee\\u2019s regular wage rate, the employer must divide the employee\\u2019s total wages for a workweek by the number of hours the employee actually worked during that workweek.\", \"Employers may not average the hours an employee works during one workweek with the hours the employee works during other weeks. An employee\\u2019s total wages may be determined on a piece-rate, salary, commission or some other basis.\", \"\", \" \", \"\", \"Compensable Time\", \"To comply with FLSA regulations, employers must keep track of the number of compensable hours employees work during a workweek. \", \"Compensable time (or hours worked) ordinarily includes all time during which employees are required to be on the employer's premises, on duty or at a prescribed workplace. \\u201cWorkday\\u201d generally means the period between the time on any particular day when employees commence their \\u201cprincipal activity\\u201d and the time on that day when they cease that principal activity or activities. For this reason, an employee\\u2019s workday may be longer than his or her scheduled shift, hours, tour of duty or production line times.\", \"Employers should consider the following circumstances when calculating an employee\\u2019s amount of accrued compensable time:\", \"Waiting Time: Whether waiting time is \\u201chours worked\\u201d under the FLSA depends upon the particular circumstances. Generally, if employees engaged to wait are working during these periods of inactivity, they must be paid for this time. Examples of waiting time that would be considered hours worked would be the time spent by a line worker waiting for a machine to be repaired or a fireman who reads a book while waiting for an alarm.\", \"On-call Time: Any time employees are required to remain on call at the employer's premises likely qualifies as working time. However, time employees are required to remain on call at home often will not qualify as working time.\", \"Rest and Meal Periods: Short rest periods (usually 20 minutes or less) are common in certain industries and must be counted as hours worked. Unauthorized extensions of authorized work breaks do not need to be counted as compensable time when the employer has communicated to employees that the authorized break may only last for a specific length of time, that any extension of the break is contrary to the employer's rules, and any extension of the break will be punished. Meal periods (typically 30 minutes or more) generally are not compensated as work time, but only if employees are completely relieved from their work responsibilities for the purpose of eating a meal. Employees are not relieved of their responsibilities if they are required to perform any duties\\u2014whether active or inactive\\u2014while eating.\", \"Sleeping Time and Certain Other Activities: Employees who are required to be on duty for less than 24 hours are working even if they are permitted to sleep or engage in other personal activities when not busy. Employees required to be on duty for 24 hours or more may agree with the employer to exclude regularly scheduled sleeping periods of not more than eight hours from their compensable time. This arrangement is valid only when employers provide adequate sleeping facilities and the employees can usually get an uninterrupted night's sleep of at least five hours.\", \"Lectures, Meetings and Training Programs: An employee\\u2019s attendance to lectures, meetings, training programs and similar activities need not be counted as compensable time if the activity is outside normal hours, voluntary, not related to the employee\\u2019s job and the employee does not perform any concurrent work.\", \"Travel Time: Daily home to work travel is not work time; however, travel from jobsite to jobsite during the workday must be counted as hours worked. Travel from home to work on a special one-day assignment in another city (less the time the employee would normally spend commuting) or travel away from the employee\\u2019s home community overnight is considered compensable time and must be included in the employee\\u2019s accrued number of hours worked.\", \"Common Overtime Mistakes\", \"\", \"Compliance Strategies\", \"One easy way to ensure compliance with FLSA requirements is to make sure all personnel, employees and supervisors alike, understand the FLSA\\u2019s rights and protections. The DOL FLSA poster provides a brief summary of FLSA provisions and can serve as a reminder of employer obligations. \", \"All employers covered by the FLSA must display this official poster. The poster must be displayed in a conspicuous place, in all of the employer\\u2019s establishments, in a way that makes the poster readily available for reading by all employees.\", \"A downloadable version of the poster is available at https://www.dol.gov/general/topics/posters.\", \"Preventing Violations\", \"Establishing adequate recordkeeping systems and implementing sensible time-tracking policies are vital to prevent FLSA violations. To ensure that systems and procedures are functioning as planned, employers can conduct periodic, internal audits. These audits should review:\", \"Work hour records;\", \"Job descriptions; \", \"Payroll records; and\", \"Personnel training curriculum.\", \"The audits should look specifically at each employee\\u2019s employment relationship, exemption status, regular rate calculation, overtime hours and whether managers, supervisors and employees are being adequately trained. \", \"Preventing Litigation\", \"If a problem surfaces during an audit (or through any other means), employers may be able to avoid legal actions by fixing legitimate issues promptly. After solving the problem, employers should determine the cause and take any steps needed to ensure, to the best of their ability, that the problem doesn\\u2019t happen again. Solving the problem may require paying back wages, adjusting a job description or reclassifying employees altogether.\", \"Finally, employers should evaluate how best communicating the problem and its solution to any affected individuals. \", \"More Information\", \"Please contact Prospero Benefits & Insurance Services, Inc. for more information on the Fair Labors Standards Act. \"]"
