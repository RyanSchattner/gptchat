"[\"A health FSA is an employer-sponsored account that employees can use to pay for (or reimburse themselves for) qualifying medical expenses on a tax-free basis.  Unlike a health savings account (HSA), employees do not need to be covered by a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) in order to participate in a health FSA. Health FSAs can be offered with any other type of health plan. \", \"Both employers and employees can make health FSA contributions, in contrast to a health reimbursement arrangement (HRA) where only the employer is allowed to make contributions. Employees may contribute pre-tax dollars to their health FSAs through a Section 125 plan (or cafeteria plan).  Employers do not pay FICA or unemployment taxes on employees\\u2019 health FSA contributions. \", \"Often, employers will set a maximum annual amount that employees may contribute to their health FSAs. Effective for plan years beginning on or after Jan. 1, 2013, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) limits employees\\u2019 pre-tax health FSA contributions each year. Employers may continue to impose limits on employee health FSA contributions, as long as the employer\\u2019s limit does not exceed the ACA\\u2019s maximum limit. For plan years beginning in 2021, the dollar limitation on employee salary reduction contributions to a health FSA is $2,750.  \", \"Employees may use their health FSAs to pay for (or reimburse themselves for) their own qualifying medical expenses, as well as their spouses\\u2019 and dependents\\u2019 qualifying medical expenses.  Qualifying medical expenses are unreimbursed medical care expenses, as defined under Section 213(d) of the Internal Revenue Code. An employer may more narrowly define the expenses that can be reimbursed from an employee\\u2019s health FSA. Unlike HSAs, health FSAs cannot be used to pay for non-medical expenses. \", \"There are two unique rules that apply to health FSAs. \", \"Under the uniform coverage rule, an employee\\u2019s annual health FSA election amount (minus any reimbursements already made) must be available to him or her at any time during the plan year*, regardless of how \", \"much the employee has contributed up to that point. For example, if an employee elects to contribute $750 to their FSA, the entire $750 must be available to the employee for reimbursement immediately, even though their contributions will be divided throughout the year.\", \"FSAs employ a use-it-or-lose-it model. If there are unused funds in the FSA at the end of the year (or after the grace period), the employee forfeits those funds. However, employers also have the option of allowing employees to carry over up to $550* of unused funds from one year to the next beginning in 2021. In addition, any amount that is carried over does not count toward the maximum contribution limit. \", \"*Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Notice 2021-15 from the IRS provides flexibility to employers offering FSAs or dependent care assistance programs. These flexibilities allow employers to:\", \"Provide flexibility for the carry-over of unused amounts from the 2020 and 2021 plan years;\", \"Provide flexibility to extend the permissible period for incurring claims for plan years ending in 2020 and 2021, allowing employers to extend the grace period to 12 months;\", \"Provide flexibility to adopt a special rule regarding post-termination reimbursements from health FSAs, which allows employers to permit employees who cease plan participation during 2020 or 2021 to continue to receive reimbursements from unused amounts through the end of the plan year in which their participation ended;\", \"Provide flexibility for a special claims period and carry-over rule for dependent care assistance programs when a dependent \\\"ages out\\\" during the COVID-19 public health emergency. For purposes of determining dependent care assistance that may be paid or reimbursed, the maximum age is increased from 13 to 14 years of age; and\", \"Allow certain mid-year election changes for health FSAs and dependent care assistance programs for plan years ending in 2021.\", \"\"]"
