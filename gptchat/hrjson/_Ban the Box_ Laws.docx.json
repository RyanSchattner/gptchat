In 1998, Hawaii became the first state to adopt a ban the box law. Since then, a number of states and municipalities have passed similar laws. \", \"The policy goal behind ban the box laws is to give individuals with criminal histories a more fair opportunity to compete for jobs. Removing conviction history questions from job applications allows employers to judge applicants based on their qualifications first, rather than their criminal histories. Because employment has been found to be a significant factor in reducing re-offending, ban the box laws also help promote stable communities. \", \"In general, states with ban the box laws do not completely prohibit employers from asking about an individual\\u2019s criminal background. However, employers are typically prohibited from doing so until later in the hiring process as part of a conditional job offer.\", \"overview \", \"Ban the box laws generally prohibit employer from asking job candidates about their criminal backgrounds on job applications or as part of the initial application and interview process.

However, employers are typically prohibited from doing so until later in the hiring process \\u2013 usually after making a conditional job offer. In most cases, an employer can withdraw an offer of employment if the applicant has a conviction record that bears a rational relationship to the duties and responsibilities of the position. Some laws also limit the number of years an employer can look back into an applicant or employee\\u2019s criminal history.\", \"federal law\", \"Federal law does not regulate when or how an employer might acquire a candidate\\u2019s or employee\\u2019s criminal history information. However, the Fair Credit Reporting Act establishes procedures that employers must follow when they obtain criminal history information through a third-party consumer reporting agency. In addition, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has issued enforcement guidance stating that an \\u201cemployer's use of an individual's criminal history in making employment decisions may, in some instances, violate the prohibition against employment discrimination under Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act (Title VII). Specifically, an employer\\u2019s use of criminal history information may violate Title VII if it results in:\", \"Job applicants with the same criminal records being treated differently because of their race, color, religion, sex or national origin (disparate treatment discrimination); or\", \"A disproportionate and unjustifiable exclusion of individuals of a particular race or national origin (disparate impact discrimination).\", \"Under Title VII, an exclusion is considered unlawful if the employer cannot show that the reason for it is \\u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity\\u201d for the position being considered. \", \"state laws\", \"As of November 2020, 35 states, plus the District of Columbia, have passed ban the box legislation for public employers. In addition, 14 states have adopted these laws for private employers. \", \"The table below lists the states that have enacted ban the box laws and includes general information about the provisions that apply to private employers in each state. (Note: In addition to these laws, municipal requirements may also apply. Over 150 cities and counties have enacted similar laws.)\", \"\"]"
