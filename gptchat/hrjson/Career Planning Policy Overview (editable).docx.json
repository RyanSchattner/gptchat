"[\"\", \"Career Planning Policy Overview\", \"A Human Resource Guide 2021\", \"\", \"When to Use \", \"A major reason why talented, high performing employees leave their employer is because their career growth and development needs are not being met. A career planning policy indicates that the employer is committed to the long-term investment of its employees. This policy should be applied to all employees in the organization. This policy should be provided to each employee at the time of its implementation and as part of the onboarding of new hires. The career planning process should start near the end of the first year of employment, before the employee's first year anniversary. The implementation of this policy should be incorporated into the organization's other HR policies and practices.\", \"Tips \", \"Employers should train all supervisory employees in how to conduct a career development discussion, how to complete IDP forms, and what their career development responsibilities are as supervisors.\", \"Employers should educate all employees on the career planning process and what their responsibilities are as participants. Employers should include information about how future workforce needs are related to the employer's strategic plan.\", \"HR should create a databank of job descriptions for use by supervisors and employees in understanding the requirements and responsibilities of various jobs.\", \"HR should create sample career paths that can apply to large segments of the workforce as an example.\", \"HR should provide access to various sources of training and development programs for use in completing the IDP.\", \"HR should monitor career planning policy compliance and compile or analyze the types of developmental activities being implemented.\", \"\", \"Warnings \", \"\", \"Career plans are based on the combination of employee and employer contributions. Employees bring to the equation career aspirations, interests, job performance, and the capability of fulfilling developmental requirements. Employers bring their assessment of the employee's ability to reach their desired career goals and the capability of investing in the employee's career development. It is through an open dialogue that mutually agreed-upon career development activities happen. \", \"This policy should be implemented without regard to employees' employment level and protected class status. Those employees covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act should be provided reasonable accommodations to participate in career development activities.\"]"
