"[\"\", \"Overtime Pay Laws\", \"Federal overtime wage payment requirements are governed by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). California law also regulates certain provisions of overtime wage payment. Under both federal and state laws, employees must receive overtime wage rates for any overtime work performed.\", \"The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), part of the California Department of Industrial Relations (DIR) , enforces overtime standards throughout the state.\", \"Overtime Pay\", \"In California, the overtime wage rate depends on when the overtime work takes place, as described below. Because overtime calculations depend on the number of hours worked per day or per week, employers cannot average the hours an employee works during one day or one week with the hours the employee works on any other workday or workweek. \", \"Alternative Workweek Schedules\", \"California\\u2019s overtime wage payment requirements apply differently to individuals who work under an alternative workweek schedule. An \\u201calternative workweek schedule\\u201d is a work schedule that allows an employee to work more than eight hours during a workday without accruing overtime.\", \"Under alternative workweek schedules, employers must compensate their employees for overtime work they perform over 10 hours during a workday and 40 hours during a workweek.\", \"Calculating the Regular Rate of Pay\", \"An employee\\u2019s regular wage rate is the actual rate of pay he or she receives for a standard, non-overtime workweek. Employers must calculate their employees\\u2019 regular rate before they can determine applicable overtime wages. An employee\\u2019s regular rate can vary from week to week and may be different from the employee\\u2019s contractual rate of pay.\", \"An employee\\u2019s regular rate for a specific work period is calculated by dividing the employee\\u2019s entire compensation for a workweek by the number of hours the employee worked during that period. An employee\\u2019s entire compensation is all compensation paid to the employee. Generally, this includes the employee\\u2019s hourly rate, shift differential, non-discretionary bonuses, production bonuses and commissions, and excludes reimbursements for business expenses, bona fide gifts, discretionary bonuses, employer-investment contributions and payment for non-working hours (for example, pay for vacation, sick leave or jury duty).\", \"A workweek in California is a fixed period of 168 hours, or seven consecutive 24-hour workdays. The workweek can begin on any day of the week and at any hour of the day, without coinciding with a calendar week. To determine the number of hours an employee works during a workweek, the employer must consider any time during which the employee was subject to the employer\\u2019s control. This includes any time the employee is:\", \"Allowed to work (regardless of whether he or she is required to work);\", \"Waiting for a job assignment;\", \"Waiting to begin work;\", \"Cleaning or performing other \\u201coff the clock\\u201d duties; and\", \"Traveling under the request, control or direction of the employer (excluding normal commuting time to and from work).\", \"Executive, Administrative, Professional Employee Exemptions\", \"Executive, administrative and professional employees are exempt from the state\\u2019s overtime pay requirements if their job duties match the descriptions in the table below and they earn a monthly salary equivalent to no less than two times the state minimum wage for full-time employment.
