"[\"\", \"In 2014, California adopted the Healthy Workplaces, Healthy Families Act, which is more commonly referred to as California\\u2019s Paid Sick Leave law. This law requires all California employers, regardless of size, to provide employees who work 30 or more days in a calendar year with at least 24 hours of paid sick leave per year. \", \"The California Department of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), which is also known as the California Labor Commissioner\\u2019s Office, has published FAQs to assist employers in implementing the law. These FAQs are provided in part below and reflect updates made in March, 2017. \", \"EMPLOYEE ELIGIBILITY FOR PAID SICK LEAVE \", \"How do employees qualify for paid sick leave?\", \"An employee qualifies for paid sick leave by working for an employer on or after Jan. 1, 2015, for at least 30 days within a year in California and by satisfying a 90-day employment period (which works like a probationary period) before the employee can actually take any sick leave.\", \"What if an employee works less than 30 days in California within a year?\", \"If an employee works less than 30 days in California within a year, then he or she is not entitled to paid sick leave under this law.\", \"What if an employee works more than 30 days but less than 90 days in California within a year?\", \"The 90-day period works like a probationary period.\\u00a0An employee is not entitled to take paid sick leave if he or she works fewer than 90 days for the employer.\", \"When is an employee entitled to take paid sick leave?\", \"A qualifying employee began accruing paid sick leave beginning on July 1, 2015, or on his or her first day of employment if hired after that date. An employee is entitled to use (take) paid sick leave beginning on the 90th day of employment.\", \"Why did the law take effect Jan. 1, 2015, if employees did not begin accruing until July 1, 2015?\", \"The different dates were a result of the general effective dates of new legislation (on Jan. 1 following enactment of the law) and the way the law was drafted, making some of its provisions operative on a specified date (July 1, 2015). Both the qualifying periods that determine which employees are eligible for paid sick leave and the employee notice required by Labor Code 2810.5 became effective on Jan. 1, 2015, but the law provides that entitlement did not begin until July 1, 2015.\", \"Does paid sick leave apply to all employees who work in California?\", \"An employee who works at least 30 days for the same employer within a year in California, including part-time, per diem and temporary employees, are covered by the law, with some specific exceptions. \", \"Employees who are exempt from the paid sick leave law include: \", \"Providers of publicly funded In-Home Supportive Services (IHSS); \", \"Employees covered by collective bargaining agreements with specified leave provisions;\", \"Individuals employed by an air carrier as a flight deck or cabin crew member, if they receive compensated time off that is at least equivalent to the requirements of the new law; and \", \"Retired annuitants working for governmental entities. \", \"What if an individual is employed by a staffing agency?\", \"Temporary employees of a staffing agency are covered. Therefore, whoever is the employer or joint employer is required to provide paid sick leave to qualifying employees.\", \"ACCRUING AND TAKING PAID SICK LEAVE\", \"If an employee qualifies, how much paid sick leave is he or she entitled to take and be paid for?\", \"This depends on what kind of plan the employer chooses to offer in order to comply with the law. Employers can have either an \\u201caccrual\\u201d policy or a \\u201cno accrual/up front\\u201d policy.\", \"An accrual policy is one where employees earn sick leave over time, with the accrued time carrying over in each year of employment. In general terms (and subject to some exceptions), employees under an accrual plan must earn at least one hour of paid sick leave for each 30 hours of work (the 1:30 schedule). Although employers may adopt or keep other types of accrual schedules, the schedule must result in an employee having at least 24 hours of accrued sick leave or paid time off by the 120th calendar day of employment. \", \"Although employees may accrue more than three days of paid sick leave under the 1:30 schedule, the law allows employers to limit an employee\\u2019s use of paid sick leave to 24 hours (three days) during a year. The law also allows an employer to limit an employee\\u2019s total accrued paid sick leave to no more than 48 hours or six days. \", \"A no accrual/up front policy makes the full amount of sick leave for the year available immediately at the beginning of a year-long period, except for initial hires where it must be available for use by the 120th day of employment. The employer must provide at least 24 hours or three days of paid sick leave per year and the full amount of this leave must be available for the employee\\u2019s use from the beginning of each year of employment, calendar year, or 12-month period. The employer determines how the year will be calculated, whether it tracks a typical calendar year, fiscal year, or other 12-month period. \", \"How is a year measured?\", \"This varies but it will usually be tracked by an employee\\u2019s hiring anniversary date.\", \"Can an employer provide or advance paid sick leave to an employee prior to the employee\\u2019s accrual of sufficient paid leave time or prior to meeting the 90-day employment requirement? \", \"Yes. An employer may elect to advance sick leave to an employee before it is accrued, but there is no requirement for an employer to do so.\", \"Why does the law let employees accrue more time than they can use in a year?\", \"Accrual, carryover and use are all distinct concepts. Accrual is based on the number of hours an employee works; the amount carried over to the next year may be subject to a cap if the employer establishes a cap by policy; and, finally, use may be limited to three days per year.\", \"What happens if an employee is seasonal and only works 60 days one year but returns to the same employer within one year and works another 60 days? \", \"The paid sick leave law requires that accrued and unused sick leave be restored to an employee who returns to the same employer within 12 months from the previous separation. \", \"Employers are not required to restore previously accrued and unused paid time off (PTO), if the sick leave was provided pursuant to a PTO policy covering sick leave which was paid or cashed out to the employee at the end of the previous employment with that employer.\", \"What happens if an employee returns to work for the same employer after more than one year?\", \"The paid sick leave law does not require that an employee\\u2019s accrued sick leave be restored.\", \"If an employee works part time, six hours per day, and he or she has accrued 24 hours of paid sick leave and he or she takes three paid sick days, can his or her employer refuse to allow the employee to take any more sick leave in that same year?\", \"No. Because the statute provides that an employer may limit the amount of sick leave to 24 hours or three days, and because the employee works six hours per day, he or she has only used 18 of the 24 hours. For enforcement purposes, DLSE interprets the reference to \\u201cthree days\\u201d to state an equivalent of 24 hours (based on an eight-hour workday) and is not a limitation that can be used to prohibit a part-time employees from using at least 24 hours of accrued leave in a year. Therefore, the minimum amount that an employee has to be allowed to take cannot fall below 24 hours. In this situation, the employee still has six hours of accrued leave remaining to take and be paid for, during the year.\", \"EMPLOYER POLICIES CAN PROVIDE MORE PAID SICK LEAVE BUT NOT LESS\", \"What happens when an employer has its own Paid Time Off (PTO) plan?\", \"The law establishes a minimum requirement, but an employer can provide sick leave through its own plan or establish different plans for different categories of workers.\\u00a0However, each plan must satisfy the accrual, carryover and use requirements of the law or put the full amount of leave into their employees\\u2019 leave banks at the beginning of each year in accordance with its PTO policy. \", \"If an employer provides a policy that exceeds the minimum requirements, including providing a specific cap, the policy must be clear as to the additional terms that apply to its employees.\", \"How does an employer satisfy the provision for putting the full amount of leave into an employee\\u2019s leave bank under the alternative \\u201cup-front\\u201d (or advance) method for providing paid sick leave?\", \"An employer must have a paid leave policy that satisfies the same purposes required by the paid sick leave law and must provide no less than 24 hours or three days of paid sick leave for employees to use each year.\\u00a0Therefore, the full amount of accrued leave must be available to an employee at the beginning of the 12-month period. For initial hires, however, employees must still meet the 90-day employment requirement prior to taking any paid sick leave.\", \"Under the accrual method, can an employee carry over unused sick leave from one year to the next?\", \"Yes, but an employer can limit or cap the amount of sick leave an employee may carryover to six days or 48 hours.\", \"If an employer provides paid time off that employees can use for vacation or illness, does the employer have to provide additional sick leave?\", \"No, as long as the employer provides at least 24 hours per year of paid leave that can be used for health care and meets other requirements in the law.\", \"If an employer offers unlimited time off, how are they affected by the new law?\", \"Most employers with this new but growing policy do not track how much time employees take off or for what reason. Although the new law requires that employers separately track sick leave accrual and use, for employers with unlimited paid time off plans, the notice, itemized pay stub or separate written statement provided with the payment of wages meets this requirement by indicating the paid sick leave is \\u201cunlimited.\\u201d v\", \"PURPOSES FOR WHICH AN EMPLOYEE MAY TAKE PAID SICK LEAVE\", \"What can an employee use paid sick leave for? \", \"Employees can take their paid sick leave for their own or a family member\\u2019s preventive care, existing health condition care or for specified purposes if they are a victim of domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking.\\u00a0\", \"Family members include the employee\\u2019s parent, child, spouse, registered domestic partner, grandparent, grandchild and sibling.\\u00a0Preventive care would include annual physicals or flu shots.\\u00a0For partial days, employers can require an employee to take at least two hours of leave, but otherwise the determination of how much time is needed is left to the employee.\", \"Do employees have to provide notice when they need to take their paid leave?\", \"Employers must permit the employee to use the paid sick leave upon an oral or written request, and the law forbids requiring an employee to find a replacement as a condition for using leave.\\u00a0If the need is foreseeable, the employee must give reasonable advance notice, but where the need is unforeseeable the employee need only give notice as soon as practicable.\", \"PAYMENT AND TRACKING OF EARNED AND TAKEN LEAVE\", \"When an employee takes paid sick leave, how are they paid for the applicable pay period?\", \"The law requires that an employer provide payment for sick leave taken by an employee\\u00a0no later than the payday for the next regular payroll period after the sick leave was taken. This does not prevent an employer from making the adjustment in the pay for the same payroll period in which the leave was taken, but it permits an employer to delay the adjustment until the next payroll. \", \"For example, if an employee did not clock in for a shift and therefore was not paid for it but utilized their paid sick leave, the employer would have to pay the employee no later than the following pay period and account for it in the wage stub or separate itemized wage statement for that following regular pay period.\", \"How much must employers pay employees when they use paid sick leave?\", \"Employees must be paid at their regular hourly rate. If an employee\\u2019s pay fluctuates\\u2014for example, if the employee gets a commission or piece rate\\u2014the employer must divide the employee\\u2019s total compensation for the previous 90 days by the number of hours worked and pay the employee at that rate.\", \"How will employees know how much sick leave they have accrued?\", \"Employers must show, on an employee\\u2019s pay stub or a document issued the same day as their paycheck, how many days of sick leave they have available. Employers also must keep records showing how many hours an employee has earned and used for three years.\\u00a0This information may be stored on documents available to employees electronically.\", \"Do employers have to document the reason an employee uses paid sick leave? \", \"No. The law states that an employer is not obligated to inquire into, or record, the purposes for which an employee uses paid sick leave or paid time off.\", \"How does the new law interact with local sick leave ordinances?\", \"For employees subject to local sick leave ordinances, the employer will have to comply with both the local and California laws, which may differ in some respects. For each provision or benefit, the employer will have to provide whichever is more generous to the employee.\", \"If an employee works an alternative work schedule of four 10-hour days and takes paid sick leave, how much should the employee be paid?\", \"The paid sick leave law allows the employee to decide how much paid leave time to take, subject to the employer\\u2019s ability to set a two-hour minimum. Therefore, if the employee has ten hours in their bank, they can request to be paid for 10 hours. If the employee decides to take less time than that in paid sick leave, then they will not receive their full pay but will instead pay for the number of hours that they chose to take. If an employee is sick for three days and has accrued 24 hours, then the employer will have to pay the employee for 24 hours. However, if the employee has accrued 30 hours, then, because the minimum requirements of the statute are three days or 24 hours, they will have to be paid for 30 hours.\", \"If an employee leaves his or her job, can they cash out unused sick days?\", \"No, not unless his or her employer\\u2019s policy provides for a payout. However, if an employee leaves his or her job and gets rehired by the same employer within 12 months, the employee can reclaim the paid sick leave he or she had in his or her leave bank.\", \"REQUIRED INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED TO EMPLOYEES\", \"Are employers required to inform employees of their paid sick leave rights?\", \"Yes. Employers are required to place a poster in a conspicuous location at the workplace containing the following information: (1) that an employee is entitled to accrue, request and use paid sick days; (2) the amount of sick days provided for and the terms of use of paid sick days; (3) that retaliation or discrimination against an employee who requests paid sick days or uses paid sick days or both is prohibited; and (4) that an employee has the right under this law to file a complaint with the Labor Commissioner against an employer who retaliates or discriminates against an employee. The law required the Labor Commissioner to develop a model poster that meets these requirements, which is now available on the Labor Commissioner\\u2019s website.\", \"Employers are also required to provide most employees with an individualized Notice to Employee\\u00a0(required under Labor Code section 2810.5) that includes paid sick leave information. The Notice to Employee requirement does not apply to exempt employees, most government employees or employees covered by a valid collective bargaining agreement that meets certain specifications.\", \"What if an employer\\u2019s policy has different terms from the paid sick leave law?\", \"The state law providing for paid sick leave creates minimum standards for paid sick leave. Employers may use their existing policies so long as the specific policy complies with the minimum requirements of the law. Where the employer provides additional terms (such as caps on maximum use or accruals above the minimums), they must inform employees of those additional terms. The revised Notice to Employee form has a check box to inform an employee of an employer\\u2019s own policy that meets or exceeds the requirements of the new law. \", \"To avoid misinformation or misunderstanding regarding an employer\\u2019s specific paid leave policy, employers are encouraged to ensure that employees are made fully aware of the terms and conditions of their specific policy that provides any additional paid sick leave terms. Although the notice requirements of Labor Code section 2810.5 do not apply to employees who are exempt from the payment of overtime, employees who are exempt from the payment of overtime are covered by this new paid sick leave law.\", \"Do employers have to issue new notices to employees who were hired prior to Jan. 1, 2015?\", \"Yes. An employer must individually notify all employees hired prior to Jan. 1, 2015, of changes to terms and conditions of employment that relate to paid sick leave within seven days of the actual change. Information concerning any new or previously existing paid sick leave program that includes information required to be given to each employee by Labor Code section 2810.5(a), must be provided to all employees. A revised DLSE notice form, available on the DLSE website, may be used for providing individual notice to these existing employees unless the employer chooses an authorized alternative method.\", \"PAID SICK LEAVE AND EMPLOYER ATTENDANCE POLICIES\", \"Can an employer discipline employees for taking a paid sick day or for using paid sick leave for part of a day to go to a doctor\\u2019s appointment?\\u00a0 \", \"No, an employer may not discipline an employee for using accrued paid sick leave.\\u00a0 Depending on the circumstances, however, the issue may be more complex and may require more analysis.\\u00a0 \", \"In general, if an employee has accrued sick days available, an employer may not deny the employee the right to use those accrued paid sick days, including the right to use paid sick leave for a partial day (for example, to attend a doctor\\u2019s appointment), and may not discipline the employee for doing so. \", \"Many employers have attendance policies under which employees may be given an \\u201coccurrence\\u201d or similar adverse personnel action (which is a form of discipline with potentially negative repercussions) if the employee has an unscheduled absence or provides insufficient notice of an absence.\\u00a0Under the paid sick leave and other laws, if an employee has accrued and available sick leave, and is using his or her accrued paid sick leave for a purpose as specified in the law, it is not permissible for an employer to give the employee an \\u201coccurrence\\u201d for the absence under such an attendance policy, because this would constitute a form of discipline against an employee for using his or her paid sick leave as allowed under the paid sick leave law.\\u00a0 \", \"If an employee does not have any accrued or available paid sick leave, however, (for example, if the employee has already used all of his or her accrued and available paid sick leave under the employer\\u2019s policy), and if the employee has an unscheduled absence that would otherwise violate the employer\\u2019s attendance policy, the paid sick leave law does not prohibit the employer from giving the employee an \\u201coccurrence\\u201d for the absence, even if the employee was actually sick and/or could have used paid sick leave for the absence if he or she had any such leave accrued. The paid sick leave law does not \\u201cprotect\\u201d all time off taken for illness or related purposes; it \\u201cprotects\\u201d only an employee\\u2019s accrued and available paid sick leave as specified in the law.\", \"Similarly, if an employee has an absence that would otherwise violate the employer\\u2019s attendance policy, and if the absence was for a reason not covered under the paid sick leave law, the employer is not required to allow the employee to use paid sick leave for that absence, and it is not a violation of the law for the employer to give an \\u201coccurrence\\u201d for such absence.\\u00a0 An employer is not required to allow an employee to use accrued paid sick days for reasons other than those listed in the law.\\u00a0 \", \"In addition, if an employee has an unscheduled absence that would otherwise result in an \\u201coccurrence\\u201d under an employer\\u2019s attendance policy, and if the employee elects to use accrued paid sick leave for only part of the unscheduled absence (for example, if the employee is absent for a full eight-hour day of work, but elects to use only four hours of his or her accrued paid sick leave for the absence [which the employee is allowed to do], the employer would be allowed to give an \\u201coccurrence\\u201d or 1/2 of an \\u201coccurrence\\u201d) for the one-half day of unscheduled absence for which no paid sick leave was used. Only time that is properly taken as accrued paid sick leave is protected from disciplinary action.\\u00a0The same would be true if the employee had a full eight-hour unscheduled absence, but only had available four hours of accrued paid sick leave.\\u00a0The portion of the unscheduled absence not covered by accrued paid sick leave could be subject to disciplinary action under the employer\\u2019s attendance policy.\\u00a0\\u00a0 \", \"Source: State of California, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement\"]"
