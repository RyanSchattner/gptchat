"[\"COBRA requires continuation coverage to extend from the date of a qualifying event for a limited period of 18 or 36 months. The length of time depends on the type of qualifying event that gave rise to the COBRA rights. However, a plan may provide longer periods of coverage beyond the maximum period required by law.\", \"When the qualifying event is the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction in hours, qualified beneficiaries are entitled to 18 months of continuation coverage.\", \"When the qualifying event is the end of employment or reduction of the employee's hours and the employee became entitled to Medicare less than 18 months before the qualifying event, COBRA coverage for the employee's spouse and dependents can last up to 36 months after the date the employee became entitled to Medicare. \", \"For example, if a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare eight months before the date his or her employment ends (termination of employment is the COBRA qualifying event), COBRA coverage for his or her spouse and children would be extended for 28 months (36 months minus eight months).\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\\t\"]"
