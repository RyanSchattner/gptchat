"[\"\", \"How to Reduce Turnover\", \"A Human Resource Guide 2021\", \"\", \"Turnover can be expensive for employers. Experts suggest that to replace an employee it can cost 25percent or more of the employee's annual compensation. In addition, the loss of institutional knowledge and productivity can erode employee morale. Identifying trends, patterns and causes can allow employers the opportunity to address issues before problems escalate. Employers concerned about employee turnover and seeking ways to reduce attrition should follow these steps.\", \"\", \"Step 1: Consider the Upside of Employee Turnover\", \"\", \"Most employers look at employee turnover only as something negative.  HOWEVER, there are benefits to employee turnover.  Employee turnover:\", \"Provides management with information about the current climate of the organization, which can lead to corrective action and positive changes;\", \"Is a natural progression of an organizations and its employees, allowing for necessary adjustments to departments, job openings and methods of doing business;\", \"May eliminate the lowest performers in the organization and leave room for an infusion of fresh talent;\", \"Provide promotional opportunities to remaining employees; and\", \"May allow changes to the organizational infrastructure.\", \"The GOAL should not be to have zero turnover rate, as this could merely indicate there are few jobs available or that employees do not have the skills to move elsewhere.  The best organizations analyze their historical patterns along with industry trends and norms to determine what constitutes a normal attrition rate for their particular situation.\", \"\", \"Step 2: Gather Information Regarding Current Employee Turnover\", \"\", \"After considering the benefits as well as the disadvantages of employee turnover, employers should collect employee turnover data for their specific organization, for their competitors, and for their industry.  The amount and type of terminations, both voluntary and involuntary, provide a good picture as their optimal turnover rate and the best strategies to manage it.\", \"\", \"There are four basic types of employee turnover.  The goal is to lower the rate of dysfunctional or avoidable turnovers:\", \"Functional:  Those viewed as acceptable losses, the poor performers.\", \"Dysfunctional: Those employees the employer would wish to retain, the best performers.\", \"Avoidable:  Circumstances could prevent it, such as poor management.\", \"Unavoidable: Circumstances could not prevent it, such as the employee moved from the area.   \", \"\", \"Identify Reasons for Turnover\", \"\", \"In addition to tracking turnover mathematically, you should also track the reasons for employee turnover.  reasons for current turnover can provide a source of possible solutions to the turnover problem. \", \"Reviewing and analyzing turnover data helps to identify what problems are occurring, and where, when and how often they occur.  Useful tools for tracking information include:\", \"Employee Exit Interviews.\", \"Absenteeism or tardiness rates.\", \"Sick leave utilization.\", \"Staff complaints.\", \"Employee job satisfaction surveys.\", \"Customer satisfaction and loyalty statistics.\", \"\", \"Consider Why Employees Stay\", \"\", \"To understand the complete picture, employers also should determine reasons why employees stay.  Some of the more commonly cited reason include:\", \"Pride in the organization.\", \"Good relationship with supervisor.\", \"Competitive compensation and benefits package.\", \"Good colleagues.\", \"Opportunity to do meaningful work.\", \"\", \"Step 3: Identify Goals for Improving Retention and Develop Solutions\", \"\", \"After gathering information, the current level of employee turnover, you should use this information to establish retention goals and identify corrective strategies to reach those goals.  \", \"\", \"Establish Employee Turnover Goals\", \"\", \"Just because the organization experiences turnover, it does not necessarily mean that there is a problem.  It is important to look at all the available data to determine if there are reasons for concern. If there are issues, then you should consider current turnover levels versus preferred turnover levels to establish goals.  \", \"\", \"Identify Possible Solutions to the Causes of Turnover\", \"\", \"Employees leave an organization for many reasons.  However, the two most commonly cited causes are the quality of the selection system for new employees and the quality of leadership.  To correct problems with turnover, you should look at our current business practices.  Often these practices are the cause of a high turnover rate.\", \"While there are a variety of methods for identifying possible solutions for turnover, such as forming an action committee, it is vital that employers enlist the aid of staff members in the identification process.  Directly involving employees empowers them and furthers their commitment to the process and the organization.  Some potential solutions include: \", \"Creating a work environment that engages employees.\", \"Developing a formal employee selection process.\", \"Hiring, training, and developing quality leaders.\", \"Rewarding leaders who have high employee retention in their groups.\", \"Holding leaders accountable for hiring and keeping good employees.\", \"Developing succession plans.\", \"Improving reward and recognition programs.\", \"Designing an effective onboarding program.\", \"Becoming an employer of choice organization.\", \"Improving communication through the organization.\", \"\", \"Step 4: Design and Implement an Action Plan\", \"\", \"After determining potential turnover solutions, you should devise and implement an action plan.  An action plan establishes a timeframe with actionable steps and assigns accountability for the implementation of solutions.  \", \"\", \"Select the Best Possible Solutions Based on Feasibility and Cost\", \"\", \"Not all solutions are reasonable, feasible, cost efficient or effective.  Therefore, it is necessary to choose those solutions that will net the most return on investment (ROI) for the employer.  When forecasting ROI, accumulate as much data as possible to establish credibility for the process.  Ideally, the forecast ill offer a range of possible ROI values, given certain assumptions, which removes some of the need for making a precise estimation. \", \"\", \"Define How to Implement an Action Plan\", \"\", \"An action plan provides a road map to meeting goals.  An action plan should be in writing and should identify:\", \"Specific solutions to be implemented.\", \"Actionable steps for each solution.\", \"Specific timeframes for completing each step as well as each solution.\", \"Staff members responsible for developing and implementing each solution.\", \"An evaluation process for implementation progress and final outcome of the plan.\", \"Specific timeframe for review of action plan and revision, if needed.\", \"Ongoing methods of monitoring employee satisfaction, retention and turnover.\", \"Methods of communicating resultant changes.\", \"\"]"
