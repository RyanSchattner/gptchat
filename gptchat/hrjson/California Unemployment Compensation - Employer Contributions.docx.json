"[\"\", \"In the United States, unemployment insurance is financed through a combination of federal and state payroll taxes. The Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) authorizes the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to collect annual federal taxes from employers. These taxes are used, in part, to fund unemployment insurance programs in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. \", \"In addition, the California Unemployment Compensation Code (CUIC) requires employers in the state to make quarterly unemployment premium payments to the California Unemployment Insurance Fund (UI Fund). \", \"COVID-19 Update: Under amendments to the CUIC that went into effect on June 29, 2020, UI benefits paid to an unemployed individual under any federal unemployment benefit program specifically created to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic may not be charged against the reserve account of a tax-rated employer, except under limited circumstances.\", \"COVERED EMPLOYERS\", \"Most employers in California are subject to the CUIC and are therefore liable to make contributions. In general, employers are liable to make UI Fund contributions if they: \", \"Pay more than $100 in wages for employment during any calendar quarter; and\", \"Employ one or more individuals for some portion of a day within the current or preceding calendar year.\", \"However, the CUIC prescribes additional criteria to determine UI Fund liability for certain employers.\", \"Employers in the Motion Picture, Radio or Television Industry\", \"Employers in the motion picture, radio or television industry are liable to make contributions to the UI Fund if they pay wages for employment pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement between an employer and a labor organization in the motion picture, radio or television industry. \", \"Motion picture payroll services companies are also liable to make contributions if they:\", \"Pay and control the payment of wages of a motion picture production worker for services either to a motion picture production company or to an allied motion picture services company; and\", \"File a statement of their intent to be the employer of motion picture production workers within 15 days after first paying wages to the workers.\", \"Domestic Employers\", \"Domestic employers are liable to make contributions to the UI Fund if they:\", \"Pay $1,000 or more in wages for employment during any calendar quarter in the current or preceding calendar year; and\", \"Employ individuals to perform domestic service in a private home, college club, fraternity or sorority.\", \"Domestic service includes in-home supportive services where the employer is:\", \"The recipient of those services, if the state or county pays for the in-home support;\", \"An individual or entity with whom a county contracts to provide in-home support; or\", \"Any county that hires and directs in-home supportive personnel.\", \"In general, employment agencies are not considered employers of domestic workers who use the employment agencies\\u2019 services for UI purposes.\", \"Work Made for Hire Contractors\", \"Any person who contracts for specially ordered or commissioned works of authorship is liable to make contributions to the UI Fund if:\", \"The parties expressly agree in a signed writing that the work will be considered a work made for hire; and\", \"The person ordering or commissioning the work obtains ownership of all copyright rights in the work.\", \"EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS\", \"An employer\\u2019s UI contribution rate is the annual percentage tax that it must pay into the UI Fund. The amount varies based on the employer\\u2019s experience rating, the condition of the UI Fund and whether the employer qualifies as a new employer.\", \"New Employers\", \"New employers are assigned a \\u201cnew employer\\u201d rate of 3.4 percent for the first two to three years of being subject to premiums and chargeable with benefits. This rate may go up or down in the second or third year, depending on whether the employer\\u2019s account has been subject to benefit charges within the 12 consecutive calendar months immediately preceding the computation date, June 30. Thereafter, an employer\\u2019s UI contribution rate is determined by its experience rating and the condition of the UI Fund. \", \"Experience-Rated Employers\", \"Experience-rated employers\\u2019 contribution rates are based on one of seven contribution rate schedules established by the CUIC. An employer\\u2019s rate is determined by its reserve ratio and the UI Fund balance. \", \"An employer\\u2019s reserve ratio is calculated by dividing the employer\\u2019s reserve account balance as of July 31 of the current year by the employer\\u2019s average taxable payroll for the previous three years. The reserve ratio is then compared to the applicable rate schedule in effect for the coming year.\", \"To determine which of the seven contribution rate schedules is in effect for the calendar year, the balance of the UI Fund on Sept. 30 of the current year is divided by the total gross wages reported by all employers during the fiscal year ending on the computation date, June 30. The resulting percentage is then compared to the following table to determine the applicable rate schedule:\", \"\", \"If the calculation produces a ratio less than 0.6 percent, an emergency solvency surcharge rate of 1.15 times the rates on Schedule F is in effect (called Schedule F+). \", \"VOLUNTARY UI CONTRIBUTION\", \"During the years when contribution rate schedules AA through D are in effect, eligible employers may voluntarily pay an additional UI contribution to obtain a lower rate. A Voluntary UI Contribution Notice (DE 2088A) is sent to eligible employers, reflecting the amounts payable to receive a lower rate. If an employer is eligible, it has until the last working day in March to submit a payment. Late payments will not be accepted under any circumstance, and extension periods will not be granted. Specific instructions are provided on the DE 2088A.\", \"Employers are not eligible to participate in the voluntary UI contribution program if they:\", \"Have a required rate of 3.4 percent;\", \"Have a negative reserve account balance;\", \"Already have been assigned the lowest possible rate;\", \"Have been notified prior to Sept. 1 of any unpaid amount owed which is not the subject of a timely petition for reassessment on Sept. 30 preceding the year to which a contribution rate is applicable; or\", \"Are subject to a penalty contribution rate, as described below.\", \"An employer may choose, but is not required, to participate in the voluntary UI contribution program. The voluntary UI contribution is not a prepayment, but an additional payment, and cannot be deducted on a future tax return. Once a voluntary payment is made, the reduced rate is in effect for the full calendar year and the payment is not refundable. \", \"Voluntary UI contributions are prohibited when rate schedule E, F or F+ is in effect.\", \"PENALTY CONTRIBUTION RATE\", \"Employers are prohibited from obtaining or attempting to obtain a more favorable contribution rate through deliberate ignorance, reckless disregard, fraud, intent to evade, misrepresentation or willful nondisclosure.
