"[\"\", \"California has numerous drug and alcohol testing laws that apply to specific employers, such as private contractors working on public improvement projects and employers in the transportation industry. \", \"For California employers that are not subject to these particular laws or regulations, there is no state statute or regulation that requires or prohibits workplace drug or alcohol testing. Instead, case law establishes the parameters of workplace testing for most private employers in the state. As a result, the legality of workplace drug testing is usually determined on a case-by-case basis.\", \"LEGALIZED MARIJUANA\", \"California enacted laws that legalized the use of marijuana for medical purposes in 1996 and for recreational purposes in 2017. Neither of these laws affect an employer\\u2019s rights to establish or enforce workplace policies pertaining to marijuana. \", \"This means that, under state law, not only can employers perform testing without any specified limitations, but they may also take adverse employment actions against an individual solely on the basis of his or her positive test for marijuana. This is the case even if the state has authorized that individual to use marijuana for medical purposes. \", \"The California Supreme Court confirmed this in its 2008 decision in Ross v. Raging Wire Telecommunications. In this case, the court held that an employee who was authorized to use marijuana for medical purposes did not have the right to sue his employer for terminating his employment based on his off-duty medical marijuana use. The court ruled that the state\\u2019s Fair Employment and Housing Act, under which the employee brought a disability discrimination claim, does not require employers to accommodate an employee\\u2019s use of drugs that are illegal under federal law. \", \"PRIVACY ISSUES\", \"In most cases involving disputes over drug or alcohol testing and employment issues, California courts will assess the employer\\u2019s testing policy to determine whether it violates an individual\\u2019s rights to privacy under the California Constitution. \", \"Specifically, courts apply a balancing test that weighs an employer\\u2019s legitimate interests in regulating the conduct of its employees against the intrusion the employer\\u2019s drug test has on an employee or applicant\\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy. \", \"In this analysis, courts may consider several factors, such as:\", \"The nature of the drug or alcohol test (including the extent to which a person is monitored while supplying urine);\", \"The equipment used for testing;\", \"The manner in which the test was administered; and\", \"The reliability of the test.\", \"California laws governing the use of medical information also require employers to keep the results of any drug or alcohol test confidential. In general, employers may not disclose an applicant or employee\\u2019s test results without first obtaining valid authorization from the individual. Under the state\\u2019s labor laws, employers must also pay for any workplace testing they require.\", \"PRE-Employment VS. Current EMPLOYEE TESTING\", \"California courts have determined that job applicants have a reduced expectation of privacy because they necessarily must disclose personal information to prospective employers during the application process. Therefore, employers in California are permitted to conduct pre-employment drug screenings as long as they ensure that:\", \"Job applicants receive notice of the drug testing requirement;\", \"The collection process minimizes intrusiveness;\", \"The test is administered in a reasonable fashion, such as part of a lawful pre-employment medical examination required of all job applicants; and\", \"Procedural safeguards restrict access to the test results.\", \"In order to conduct testing on current employees without violating privacy rights, an employer must identify compelling reasons why its interests in testing would be increased or why the employee\\u2019s privacy expectations would be reduced. For example, an employer\\u2019s reasonable belief that an employee is intoxicated at work would strengthen its argument that its testing did not violate the employee\\u2019s privacy rights.\", \"Random testing\", \"Random tests are those performed when an employer has no individualized suspicion that an employee is impaired by or has used drugs or alcohol at work. Although the California Supreme Court has not addressed whether employers may require employees to submit to random testing, lower courts in the state have ruled that random testing may be permissible only in limited circumstances, such as where an employee holds a safety- or security-sensitive position. \", \"However, employers in certain California cities may be prohibited from conducting any random employee drug tests. For example, a San Francisco ordinance prohibits employers from requesting, requiring, or conducting random or companywide drug tests under any circumstances. Employers should become familiar and comply with all laws that apply where their employees\\u2019 workplaces are located.  \", \"Enforcement\", \"An individual who believes his or her privacy rights have been violated as a result of workplace drug or alcohol testing may file a lawsuit against his or her employer. Remedies may include damages resulting from the violation and an order preventing the employer from committing further violations. An employer who intentionally violates an employee\\u2019s right to privacy may also face criminal prosecution.\", \"\", \"More information\", \"For more information on drug and alcohol testing laws in California, contact your Prospero Benefits & Insurance Services, Inc. representative. \"]"
