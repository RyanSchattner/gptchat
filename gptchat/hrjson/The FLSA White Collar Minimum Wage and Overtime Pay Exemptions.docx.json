"[\"The FLSA White Collar Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay Exemptions\", \"The federal Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) requires employers to compensate their employees for all hours employees are \\u201csuffered or permitted\\u201d to work. This means that an employer must compensate its employees for every hour the employees actually work and every hour during which employees are required to remain available for their next assignment.\", \"However, the FLSA also provides various exemptions from minimum wage and overtime payment provisions. Among these, the most common are the \\u201cwhite collar\\u201d exemptions. \", \"The white collar exemptions apply mainly to executive, administrative and professional (EAP) employees, but they also include outside sales personnel and certain computer and highly compensated employees (HCEs).\", \" \", \"\", \"The White Collar Exemptions\", \"To qualify for a white collar exemption, an employee must satisfy every applicable test for that exemption. Job titles or salary wages alone do not determine exempt status. The three tests for the white collar exemptions are the salary basis test, the salary level test and the duties test. \", \"\", \"The white collar exemptions do not apply to:\", \"\\u201cBlue collar\\u201d workers who typically perform manual labor\\u2014Blue collar worker occupations include mechanics, plumbers, electricians, construction workers and assembly line workers;\", \"Law enforcement personnel\\u2014Police officers, detectives, deputy sheriffs, state troopers, highway patrol officers, investigators, inspectors, correctional officers, parole or probation officers, and park rangers;\", \"First responders\\u2014Firefighters, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, ambulance personnel and rescue workers; or\", \"Hazardous materials workers (and similar employees), regardless of rank or pay level, who perform work such as preventing, controlling or extinguishing fires.\", \"The Salary Basis Test\", \"The salary basis test is used to make sure the employee is paid a predetermined and fixed salary that is not subject to reduction due to variations in the quality or quantity of work.\", \"The Salary Level Test\", \"The salary level test is used to ensure that the employee meets a minimum specified amount to qualify for the exemption. This salary threshold provides employers with an objective and efficient way to determine whether an employee qualifies for a white collar exemption. The current salary level is set at\", \"$684 per week ($35,568 per year) for EAP employees, and \", \"$107,432 per year for HCEs. \", \"Employers can use an employee\\u2019s bonus to satisfy up to 10 percent of the employee\\u2019s salary level requirements if the bonus, commission or other inventive pay is nondiscretionary and the employee receives this incentive pay at least annually (during any given 52-week period).\", \"Finally, a \\u201ccatch-up provision\\u201d allows employees to remain exempt when their nondiscretionary bonuses aren\\u2019t enough to meet the salary level required by an FLSA exemption. Under this provision, employers must make a \\u201ccatch-up payment\\u201d within one pay period at the end of the 52-week period before losing that employee\\u2019s exempt status. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) has warned that any catch-up payment \\u201cwill count only toward the prior year\\u2019s salary amount and not toward the salary amount in the year in which it is paid.\\u201d\", \"The Duties Test \", \"The duties test requires that the employee\\u2019s job duties conform to EAP duties, as defined by law. To satisfy the duties test, an employee\\u2019s actual work responsibilities must match the description the FLSA assigns to each exemption. This analysis requires a more thorough evaluation of whether an employee can be classified as an administrative, professional, outside sales, computer or highly compensated employee.\", \"The table below presents an overview of the job descriptions assigned for each white collar exemption.\", \"\", \"Administrative Guidance\", \"On Aug. 31, 2020 the DOL published FLSA2020-13.
