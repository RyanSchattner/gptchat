"[\"What is Insubordination?  \", \"When the term \\u201cinsubordination\\u201d is used in the workplace there needs to be a deep look into the actions that are being deemed insubordination.  \", \"The definition for insubordination is: defiance of authority; refusal to obey orders.\", \"There are three factors in determining insubordination:\", \"The employer gives the order.\", \"The employee acknowledges the order.\", \"The employee refuses to carry out the order.\", \"The order itself may take the form of a verbal directive, written instructions, the duties as described in a job description and even an implied set of duties where no formal job description exists. Employee acknowledgments can be verbal, nonverbal (nodding) or even the acceptance of a job offer. An employee's unwillingness to carry out a directive can manifest itself as a verbal refusal, a nonverbal refusal or an unreasonable delay in completing the work. Being verbally disrespectful is not a requirement here, as simply refusing to punch a time clock when directed to do so will constitute insubordination. \", \"Employer policies prohibiting insubordination often go beyond disobedience to include rude and disrespectful behaviors, best described as insolence. These behaviors can include cursing, verbal or physical intimidation, personal insults, eye rolling or mocking, as well as speaking loudly or argumentatively in front of others. Over time, insolent behaviors can also affect a manager's level of respect and ability to manage, thereby enmeshing insolence and insubordination. Employers can expect employees to show professionalism and respect toward others and may discipline them when they don't.\", \"There is one caveat: The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has opined that Section 7 rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) may be violated if an employer disciplines or terminates an employee for cursing or other typically insolent behaviors while he or she is engaged in a protected concerted activity. Therefore, employers should protect themselves by seeking legal counsel before disciplining in matters concerning the terms and conditions of employment.\", \"In addition, when addressing insolent or insubordinate behavior, the employer should consider the culture or circumstances in which an incident took place. For example, if cursing is common \\\"shop talk\\\" in the workplace, the employer would need to consider whether the language used by the employee was unusual enough to be considered abusive.\", \"Lastly, a refusal to carry out an order may result from a misunderstanding of instructions or a fear of unsafe work. In certain circumstances, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration protects workers who refuse to perform work if they believe in good faith that performing the work would put employees in imminent danger. An employee's refusal to do something that is illegal, unethical or a violation of company policy would not be considered insubordination.\", \"\", \"Now, what does that truly mean in the Infinity workplace?\", \"If an installer is being asked to do an install on a roof that they are unable to tie off on and the installer refuses to do so \\u2013 this would not be considered insubordination as it is putting the employee at risk and is a violation of company and OSHA policy.  However, if an installer is refusing to properly tie off during an install \\u2013 this would be considered insubordination as it is putting the employee and company at risk and is a direct violation of company and OSHA policy.  \", \"Another example is if a contracts processor is being told to push a job through without proper signatures from the homeowner and they refuse - this would not be considered insubordination as it is violating company policy and unethical if not illegal.  However, if a contracts processor is being told to push a job through that has all the correct signatures and they refuse \\u2013 this would be considered insubordination as they are refusing to do the job that they are required to do.\", \"If an employee is being asked to clock a 30-minute lunch break when they are not actually relieved of all duties and they refuse \\u2013 this would not be considered insubordination as it is violating Meal and Rest Break labor laws.  However, if an employee refuses to clock out for lunch break when being fully relieved of all duties \\u2013 this would be considered insubordination as they are violating the company time keeping policy.\", \"As a manager, if you have an employee who is being insubordinate, you will need to assess the severity of the situation before determining the corrective action. \", \"Low severity corrective actions:\", \"If it is a simple task an employee is refusing to do, a counseling session would be the first step.  Outline the duties and tasks that are being asked of them as part of their job description, reiterate the expectations for completing the tasks and the consequences if the insubordination continues. If the employee continues to refuse to do the task after the counseling session, a write up should be performed or a PIP.  Document the situation, outline the duties and tasks, include the expectations of completing the tasks and the consequences for not following direction.  Be sure to include a reasonable timeline to correct the behavior and a follow-up schedule to ensure the employee is on the right track.  Make sure that the employee signs the write up or PIP and send the documentation to Human Resources () to upload to the employee file.  If the insubordination continues after the attempts to correct, then the employee should be considered for termination due to insubordination.  \", \"High severity corrective action:\", \"If the severity of the insubordination could cause harm to other, harm to the company, or harm to the employee \\u2013 contact HR immediately.  HR will then assess the situation and provide guidance for corrective action.  \", \"Remember HR is here to \"]"
