If you want to buy a TV or go on vacation, you\\u2019ll have to save up for it. Simply put, you can\\u2019t expect future expenses to pay for themselves.\", \"Yet, despite this basic idea, people are still not saving for the really important expenses\\u2014emergencies and retirement. It\\u2019s easy to abstain from buying coffee for a month so you can afford new shoes, but it\\u2019s harder when the end goal is so far off. Many people believe Social Security will be enough to cover them during retirement, so they don\\u2019t buy into their retirement plans. In fact, only 54 percent of workers are earning retirement benefits at work, according to the Department of Labor (DOL). \", \"Besides the fact that Social Security only provides minor financial protection, not investing in your future can leave you vulnerable when emergencies hit before retirement age. Right now, would you be able to scrape together $2,000 in a month for an emergency? Many people couldn\\u2019t.\", \"This financial uncertainty leads to stress and all the negative effects that come with it, like absenteeism, health complications and mental fatigue. Employee financial instability affects workplace performance. Imagine trying to focus on work when you don\\u2019t know how you\\u2019ll make your monthly car payment, or how productive you\\u2019d be if you had a pile of bills waiting at home. These situations illustrate the impact financial wellness can have on job performance and overall well-being. When you feel secure, you perform better in every aspect of life. \", \"This toolkit is designed to inform you and your employees about the importance of financial wellness. The materials below help answer important questions like how to start saving, how to understand retirement plans and how to stay out of debt. Together, we can help your employees maximize their retirement benefits and enjoy a more stable financial future.\", \"\", \"\\n\", \"What is Financial Wellness?\", \"Financial wellness is the balance between having enough money to cover recurring expenses, while still saving enough to support yourself down the road\\u2014particularly during retirement. Much like physical wellness, financial wellness takes hard work. You can\\u2019t expect to run a marathon if you don\\u2019t train, just like you can\\u2019t expect to have a comfortable retirement if you don\\u2019t invest.\", \"Employees must understand that investing in personal financial wellness is the key to a secure financial future. Use the resources in this toolkit to stress this message to employees. Financial wellness education is the first step to achieving their long-term success.\", \"Why Financial Wellness is Important\", \"The road to financial wellness can be tough, but the benefits make it worth it. Consider how scary unexpected expenses are. They make you choose between something you want to buy and something you need to buy. For instance, a car accident may force you to put off a vacation because you need a vehicle to get to work. \", \"Financial wellness reminds you to save often because you never know what unexpected events may be around the corner. If you focus on financial wellness, you have to worry less about hidden costs because you\\u2019re already preparing yourself by saving money. Ideally, if you save enough, you\\u2019ll have plenty to cover surprise costs and your retirement.\", \"Moreover, financial wellness is important because the majority of Americans cannot pass a financial literacy test, according to a Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) study. The FINRA study found that many people had trouble calculating interest and putting away money for emergencies. This underscores how badly employees need financial education. It\\u2019s one thing to offer financial services like a defined contribution plan, but it\\u2019s another to inform employees about financial issues like when to take out a loan.\", \"\\n\", \"Educating Employees\", \"Financial uncertainty can be extremely debilitating for employees. It creates stress that distracts from the workplace and causes rifts that could have been prevented by proactive financial education. Even simple instruction like saving or budgeting tips can go a long way. \", \"Think about employee financial education another way: offering financial wellness tools can enable employees to get the most out of their benefits, most notably their employer-sponsored retirement plans. Why bother offering such plans if employees aren\\u2019t maximizing their value? With this in mind, consider pairing your conventional retirement plans with other financial wellness programs. \", \"How to Facilitate Financial Wellness\", \"Employee financial education looks different based on employer, but over 80 percent of employers offer some sort of financial wellness program, according to a study from Prudential. The study notes that common programs include retirement and saving calculators, and access to financial advisors. These programs can help employees understand basic financial concepts and avoid risky decisions, like payday loans. \", \"You don\\u2019t need to spend thousands of dollars to implement an effective employee financial education campaign. Even small, informative offerings can be enough to get employees thinking about their savings goals. The following are just some of the ways you can start encouraging financial wellness:\", \"Hold a class on budgeting basics.\", \"Distribute surveys about financial concepts to gauge employee understanding.\", \"Offer access to financial planners through your employee assistance program.\", \"Distribute worksheets to help employees plan for their savings goals.\", \"Provide access to debt calculator tools.\", \"Hold a meeting to explain retirement benefits before open enrollment.\", \"\", \"\\n\", \"Appendix\", \"The following resources were compiled from the DOL, with slight edits for improved readability. This appendix includes comprehensive information about saving for retirement and other long-term financial goals. These printer-friendly articles and worksheets can be extremely helpful for employees, whether they are nearing retirement or just starting their careers.\", \"Please review these documents and consider offering a selection to your employees. These tips could be just what your employees need to maximize their savings plans.\", \"\", \"\", \"\\n\", \"Your Savings Fitness Dream\", \"It starts with a dream, the dream of a secure retirement. Yet, like many people you may wonder how you can achieve that dream when so many other financial issues have priority.\", \"Besides trying to pay for daily living expenses, you may need to buy a car, pay off debts, save for your children\\u2019s education, take a vacation or buy a home. You may have aging parents to support. You may be going through a major event in your life such as starting a new job, getting married or divorced, raising children or coping with a death in the family. \", \"How do you manage all these financial challenges and at the same time try to \\u201cbuy\\u201d a secure retirement? How do you turn your dreams into reality? \", \"Start by writing down each of your goals in the Goals and Priorities Worksheet at the end of this toolkit. You may want to have family members come up with ideas. Don\\u2019t leave something out at this stage because you don\\u2019t think you can afford it. This is your wish list. \", \"Organize them into goals you want to accomplish within the next five years or less, and goals that will take longer than five years. It\\u2019s important to separate them because, as you\\u2019ll see later, you save for short-term and long-term goals differently. \", \"\", \"Write down on the Goals and Priorities Worksheet what you need to do to accomplish each goal, when do you want to accomplish it, what it will cost (we\\u2019ll tell you more about that later), what money you have set aside already and what you are willing to do to reach the goal. \", \"Look again at the order of priority. How hard are you willing to work and save to achieve a particular goal? Would you work extra hours, for example? How realistic is a goal when compared with other goals? Reorganize their priority if necessary. Put those goals that are unrealistic into your wish list. Maybe you can turn them into reality too.\", \"Beginning Your Savings Fitness Plan \", \"Now let\\u2019s look at your current financial resources. This is important because, as you will learn later in this toolkit, your financial resources affect not only your ability to reach your goals, but also your ability to protect those goals from potential financial crises. These are also the resources you will draw on to meet various life events. \", \"Calculate your net worth\", \"This isn\\u2019t as difficult as it might sound. Your net worth is simply the total value of what you own (assets) minus what you owe (liabilities). It\\u2019s a snapshot of your financial health. Use the Balance Sheet to Calculate Net Worth at the end of this toolkit to write down your information and do the calculation. \", \"First, add up the approximate value of all your assets. This includes your home (if you own one) and your checking and savings accounts. Include the current value of investments, such as stocks, real estate, certificates of deposit, retirement accounts, individual retirement accounts (IRAs), and any other retirement benefits you have. \", \"Now add up your liabilities: the remaining mortgage on your home, credit card debt, auto loans, student loans, income taxes due, taxes due on the profits of your investments (if you cashed them in), and any other outstanding bills. \", \"Subtract your liabilities from your assets. Do you have more assets than liabilities? Or is it the other way around? Your aim is to create a positive net worth, and you want it to grow each year. Your net worth is part of what you will draw on to pay for financial goals and your retirement. A strong net worth also will help you through financial crises.\", \"Review your net worth annually \", \"Recalculate your net worth once a year. It\\u2019s a way to monitor your financial health. \", \"Identify other financial resources \", \"You may have other financial resources that aren\\u2019t included in your net worth but that can help you through tough times. These include the death benefits of your life insurance policies, Social Security survivor\\u2019s benefits, health care coverage, disability insurance, liability insurance, and auto and home insurance. Although you may have to pay for some of these resources, they offer financial protection in case of illness, accidents or other catastrophes. \", \"Envision your retirement \", \"Retirement is a state of mind as well as a financial issue. You are not so much retiring from work as you are moving into another stage of your life. Some people call retirement a \\u201cnew career.\\u201d \", \"What do you want to do in that stage? Travel? Relax? Move to a retirement community or be near grandchildren? Pursue a favorite hobby? Go fishing or join a country club? Work part time or do volunteer work? Go back to school? What is the outlook for your health? Do you expect your family to take care of you if you are unable to care for yourself? Do you want to enter this stage of your life earlier than normal retirement age or later? \", \"The answers to these questions are crucial when determining how much money you will need for the retirement you desire\\u2014and how much you\\u2019ll need to save between now and then. Let\\u2019s say you plan to retire early, with no plans to work even part time. You\\u2019ll need to build a larger nest egg than if you retire later because you\\u2019ll have to depend on it far longer.\\n\", \"How\\u2019s Your Financial Fitness?\", \"Now that you have a clearer picture of your retirement goal, it\\u2019s time to estimate how large your retirement nest egg will need to be and how much you need to save each month to buy that goal. This step is critical! \", \"The vast majority of people never take this step, yet it is very difficult to save adequately for retirement if you don\\u2019t at least have a rough idea of how much you need to save every month. \", \"There are numerous worksheets and software programs that can help you calculate approximately how much you\\u2019ll need to save. Professional financial planners and other financial advisors can help as well. At the end of this toolkit, we provide the Calculate Retirement Savings Worksheet to get you started. \", \"Here are some of the basic questions and assumptions to keep in mind. \", \"How much retirement income will I need? \", \"An easy rule of thumb is that you\\u2019ll need to replace about 80 percent of your preretirement income. If you\\u2019re making $50,000 a year (before taxes), you might need about $40,000 a year in retirement income to enjoy the same standard of living you had before retirement. Think of this as your annual \\u201ccost\\u201d of retirement. \", \"However, no rule of thumb fits everyone. Expenses typically decline for retirees: taxes are smaller (though not always) and work-related costs usually disappear. But overall expenses may not decline much if you still have a home and other debts to pay off. Large medical bills may keep your retirement costs high. Much will depend on the kind of retirement you want to enjoy. Someone who plans to live a quiet, modest retirement in a low-cost part of the country will need a lot less money than someone who plans to be active, take expensive vacations and live in an expensive region. \", \"\", \"The Calculate Retirement Savings Worksheet can help you come up with a rough estimate. Every year or two, review your retirement plan and adjust your retirement savings estimate as your annual earnings grow and your vision of retirement begins to come into focus. \", \"How long will I live in retirement? \", \"Based on current estimates, a male retiring at age 65 today can expect to live approximately 21 years in retirement. A female retiring today at age 65 can expect to live approximately 24 years. \", \"These are average figures and how long you can expect to live will depend on factors such as your general health and family history. But using today\\u2019s average or past history may not give you a complete picture. People are living longer today than they did in the past, and virtually all expert opinion expects the trend toward living longer to continue. \", \"Will I have other sources of income?\", \"What other sources of income will I have? You can get your Social Security statement and an estimate of your retirement benefits on the Social Security Administration\\u2019s website, www.socialsecurity.gov/myaccount. For more information, visit their website or call 1-800-772-1213. \", \"What savings do I already have for retirement? \", \"You\\u2019ll need to build a nest egg sufficient to make up the gap between the total amount of income you will need each year and the amount provided annually by Social Security and any retirement income. This nest egg will come from your retirement plan accounts at work, IRAs, annuities and personal savings. \", \"What adjustments must be made for inflation? \", \"The cost of retirement will likely go up every year due to inflation\\u2014that is, $40,000 won\\u2019t buy as much in year five of your retirement as it will the first year because the cost of living usually rises. Although Social Security benefits are adjusted for inflation, any other estimates of how much income you need each year\\u2014and how much you\\u2019ll need to save to provide that income\\u2014must be adjusted for inflation. The annual inflation rate is about 3 percent, but it varies over time. In 1980, for instance, the annual inflation rate was 13.5 percent, but in 1998, it reached a low of 1.6 percent. When planning for your retirement it is always safer to assume a higher, rather than a lower, rate and have your money buy more than you previously thought. \", \"What will my investments return? \", \"Any calculation must take into account what annual rate of return you expect to earn on the savings you\\u2019ve already accumulated and on the savings you intend to make in the future. You also need to determine the rate of return on your savings after you retire. These rates of return will depend in part on whether the money is inside or outside a tax-deferred account. \", \"It\\u2019s important to choose realistic annual returns when making your estimates. Most financial planners recommend that you stick with the historical rates of return based on the types of investments you choose or even slightly lower. \", \"How many years do I have left until I retire? \", \"The more years you have, the less you\\u2019ll have to save each month to reach your goal. \", \"How much should I save each month? \", \"Once you determine the number of years until you retire and the size of the nest egg you need to \\u201cbuy\\u201d in order to provide the income not provided by other sources, you can estimate how much you need to save. \", \"It\\u2019s a good idea to revisit this worksheet at least every year or two. Your vision of retirement, your earnings and your financial circumstances may change. You\\u2019ll also want to check periodically to be sure you are achieving your objectives along the way. \", \"\", \"How to Prepare for Retirement with Little time Left\\n\", \"Boost Your Financial Performance\", \"Now comes the tough part. You have a rough idea of how much you need to save each month to reach your retirement goal. But how do you find that money? Where does it come from? There\\u2019s one simple trick for saving for any goal: spend less than you earn. That\\u2019s not easy if you have trouble making ends meet or if you find it difficult to resist spending whatever money you have in hand. Even people who make high incomes often have difficulty saving. But we\\u2019ve got some ideas that may help you. \", \"Let\\u2019s start with a spending plan\\u2014a guide for how we want to spend our money. Some people call this a budget, but since we\\u2019re thinking of retirement as something to buy, a spending plan seems more appropriate. A spending plan is simple to set up. Consider the following steps as a guide as you fill in the information in the Cash Flow Spending Plan at the end of this toolkit. \", \"Income \", \"Add up your monthly income: wages, average tips or bonuses, alimony payments, investment income and so on. Don\\u2019t include anything you can\\u2019t count on, such as lottery winnings or a bonus that\\u2019s not definite. \", \"Expenses \", \"Add up monthly expenses: mortgage or rent, car payments, average food bills, medical expenses, entertainment and so on. Determine an average for expenses that vary each month, such as clothing, or that don\\u2019t occur every month, such as car insurance or self-employment taxes. Review your checkbook, credit and debit card records, and receipts to estimate expenses. You will probably need to track how you spend cash for a month or two. Most of us are surprised to find out where and how much cash disappears each month. \", \"Include savings as an expense \", \"Better yet, put it at the top of your expense list. Here\\u2019s where you add in the total of the amounts you need to save each month to accomplish the goals you wrote down earlier in the Goals and Priorities Worksheet. \", \"Subtract expenses from income \", \"What if you have more expenses (including savings) than you have income? It\\u2019s not an uncommon problem. You have three choices: cut expenses, increase income or both. \", \"Cut expenses \", \"There are hundreds of ways to reduce expenses, from clipping grocery coupons and bargain hunting to comparison shopping for insurance and buying new cars less often. The section that follows on debt and credit card problems will help. You also can find lots of expense-cutting ideas in books, magazine articles and financial newsletters.\\n\", \"Increase income \", \"Take a second job, improve your job skills or education to get a raise or a better paying job, make money from a hobby or jointly decide that another family member will work.\\n\", \"Avoiding Financial Setbacks\", \"High debt and misuse of credit cards make it tough to save for retirement. Money that goes to pay interest, late fees and old bills is money that could earn money for retirement and other goals.\", \"How much debt is too much debt? \", \"Debt isn\\u2019t necessarily bad, but too much debt is. Add up what you pay monthly in car loans, student loans, credit card and charge card loans, personal loans\\u2014everything but your mortgage. Divide that total by the money you bring home each month. The result is your debt ratio. Try to keep that ratio to 10 percent or less. Total mortgage and nonmortgage debt payments should be no more than 36 percent of your take-home pay. \", \"What\\u2019s the difference between good debt and bad debt? \", \"Yes, there is such a thing as good debt. That\\u2019s debt that can provide a financial pay off. Borrowing to buy or remodel a home, pay for a child\\u2019s education, advance your own career skills or buy a car for getting to work can provide long-term financial benefits. \", \"Bad debt is when you borrow for things that don\\u2019t provide financial benefits or that don\\u2019t last as long as the loan. This includes borrowing for vacations, clothing, furniture or dining out.\", \"Do you have debt problems? \", \"Here are some warning signs: \", \"Borrowing to pay off other loans. \", \"Creditors calling for payment.\", \"Paying only the minimum on credit cards.\", \"Maxing out credit cards. \", \"Borrowing to pay regular bills. \", \"Being turned down for credit. \", \"Avoid high interest rate loans \", \"Loan solicitations that come in the mail, pawning items for cash, or payday loans in which people write postdated checks to check-cashing services are usually extremely expensive. For example, rolling over a payday loan every two weeks for a year can run up interest charges of over 600 percent! While the Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to disclose the cost of your loan expressed as an annual percentage rate, it is up to you to read the fine print telling you exactly what the details of your loan and its costs are. \", \"The key to recognizing just how expensive these loans can be is to focus on the total cost of the loan\\u2014principal and interest. Don\\u2019t just look at the monthly payment, which may be small, but adds up over time.\", \"Handle credit cards wisely \", \"Credit cards can serve many useful purposes, but people often misuse them. Take, for example, the habit of making only the 2 percent minimum payment each month. On a $2,000 balance with a credit card charging 18 percent interest, it would take 30 years to pay off the amount owed. Then imagine how fast you would run up your debts if you did this with several credit cards at the same time. \", \"How to climb out of debt \", \"Despite your best efforts, you may find yourself in severe debt. The Debt Reduction Worksheet at the end of this toolkit can help you come up with a plan to pay down your credit card and other bad debt. A credit counseling service can help you set up a plan to work with your creditors and reduce your debts. Or you can work with your creditors directly to try and work out payment arrangements.\", \"\\n\", \"Strengthening Your Financial Wellness Plan\", \"Once you\\u2019ve reduced unnecessary debt and created a workable spending plan that frees up money, you\\u2019re ready to begin saving toward retirement.\", \"You may do this through a company retirement plan or on your own\\u2014options that are covered in more detail later in this toolkit. First, however, let\\u2019s look at a few of the places where you might put your money for retirement. \", \"Savings accounts, money market mutual funds, certificates of deposit and U.S. Treasury bills\\u2014These are sometimes referred to as cash or cash equivalents because you can get to them quickly and there\\u2019s little risk of losing the money you put in. \", \"Domestic bonds\\u2014You loan money to a U.S. company or a government body in return for its promise to pay back what you loaned, with interest. \", \"Domestic stocks\\u2014You own part of a U.S. company. \", \"Mutual funds\\u2014Instead of investing directly in stocks, bonds or real estate, you can use mutual funds. These pool your money with money of other shareholders and invest it for you. A stock mutual fund, for example, would invest in stocks on behalf of all the fund\\u2019s shareholders. This makes it easier to invest and to diversify your money.\", \"Choosing Where to Put Your Money \", \"How do you decide where to put your money? Look back at the short-term goals you wrote down earlier\\u2014a family vacation, perhaps, or a down payment for a home. Remember, you should always be saving for retirement. But, for goals you want to happen soon\\u2014say, within a year\\u2014it\\u2019s best to put your money into one or more of the cash equivalents\\u2014a bank account or CD, for example. You\\u2019ll earn a little interest and the money will be there when you need it. \", \"For goals that are at least five years in the future, however, such as retirement, you may want to put some of your money into stocks, bonds, real estate, foreign investments, mutual funds or other assets. Unlike savings accounts or bank CDs, these types of investments typically are not insured by the federal government. There is the risk that you can lose some of your money. How much risk depends on the type of investment. Generally, the longer you have until retirement and the greater your other sources of income, the more risk you can afford. For those who will be retiring soon and who will depend on their investment for income during their retirement years, a low-risk investment strategy is more prudent. Only you can decide how much risk to take.\", \"\", \"The differences in the average annual returns of various types of investments over time are dramatic. Over the past 50 years, the compound annual rate of return of short-term U.S. Treasury bills, which roughly equals the return of other cash equivalents such as savings accounts, has been 4.8 percent. The compound annual rate of return of long-term government bonds over the same period has been 6.7 percent. Large-company stocks, on the other hand, while riskier, have averaged an annual return of 10.1 percent. \", \"Let\\u2019s put that into dollars. If you had invested $1 in Treasury bills 50 years ago, it would have grown to approximately $10 today. However, inflation, at an annual average of 4.1 percent, would have eaten about $9 of that gain, leaving $1 as the return. If the $1 had been invested in government bonds, it would have grown to about $26, with $3 left after inflation. If the $1 had been invested in large-company stocks, it would have grown to nearly $123, with about $17 left after inflation. None of these rates of return is guaranteed in the future, but they clearly show the relationship between risk and potential reward.\", \"Many financial experts feel it is important to save at least a portion of your retirement money in higher risk\\u2014but potentially higher returning\\u2014assets. These higher risk assets can help you stay ahead of inflation, which eats away at your nest egg over time. \", \"Which assets you want to invest in, of course, is your decision. Never invest in anything you don\\u2019t thoroughly understand or don\\u2019t feel comfortable about.\", \"\\n\", \"Personal Financial Fitness\", \"There are two main ways to reduce risk. \", \"First, diversify within each category of investment. You can do this by investing in pooled arrangements, such as mutual funds, index funds and bank products offered by reliable professionals. These investments typically give you a small share of different individual investments and will allow you to spread your money among many stocks, bonds and other financial instruments, even if you don\\u2019t have a lot of money to invest. Your risk of losing money is less than if you buy shares in only a few individual companies. Distributing your investments in this way is called diversification. \", \"Second, you can reduce risk by investing among categories of investments. Generally speaking, you should put some of your money in cash, some in bonds, some in stocks and some in other investment vehicles. Studies show that once you have diversified your investments within each category, the choices you make about how much to put in these major categories is the most important decision you will make and should define your investment strategy.\", \"Why diversify? \", \"Because at any given time one investment or type of investment might do better than another. Diversification lets you manage your risk in a particular investment or category of investments and decreases your chances of losing money. In fact, the factors that can cause one investment to do poorly may cause another to do well. Bond prices, for example, often go down when stock prices are up. When stock prices go down, bonds often increase in value. Over a long time\\u2014the time you probably have to save for retirement\\u2014the risk of losing money or earning less than you would in a savings account tends to decline. \", \"By diversifying into different types of assets, you are more likely to reduce risk and actually improve return, than by putting all of your money into one investment or one type of investment. The familiar saying \\u201cDon\\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket\\u201d definitely applies to investing. \", \"Deciding on an investment mix \", \"How you diversify\\u2014that is, how much you decide to put into each type of investment\\u2014is called asset allocation. For example, if you decide to invest in stocks, how much of your retirement nest egg should you put into stocks: 10 percent, 30 percent or 75 percent? How much into bonds and cash? Your decision will depend on many factors: how much time you have until retirement, your life expectancy, the size of your current nest egg, other sources of retirement income, how much risk you are willing to take and how healthy your current financial picture is, among others. \", \"Your asset allocation also may change over time. When you are younger, you might invest more heavily in stocks than bonds and cash. As you get older and enter retirement, you may reduce your exposure to stocks and hold more in bonds and cash. You also might change your asset allocation because your goals, risk tolerance or financial circumstances have changed. \", \"\", \"Rebalancing your portfolio\", \"Once you\\u2019ve decided on your investment mix and invested your money, over time some of your investments will go up and others will go down. If this continues, you may eventually have a different investment mix than you intended. \", \"\", \"Reassessing your mix, or rebalancing, as it is commonly called, brings your portfolio back to your original plan. Rebalancing also helps you to make logical, not emotional, investment decisions. For instance, instead of selling investments in a sector that is declining, you would sell an investment that has made gains and, with that money, purchase more in the declining investment sector. This way, you rebalance your portfolio mix, lessen your risk of loss and increase your chance for greater returns in the long run.\", \"Here\\u2019s how rebalancing works: Let\\u2019s say your original investment called for 10 percent in U.S. small company stocks. Because of a stock market decline, they now represent 6 percent of your portfolio. You would sell assets that had increased and purchase enough U.S. small company stocks so they again represent 10 percent of your portfolio. \", \"How do you know when to rebalance? \", \"There are two methods of rebalancing: calendar and conditional. \", \"Calendar rebalancing means that once a quarter or once a year you will reduce the investments that have gone up and will add to investments that have gone down. \", \"Conditional rebalancing is done whenever an asset class goes up or down more than some percentage, such as 25 percent. This method lets the markets tell you when it is time to rebalance.\", \"\\n\", \"Maximizing Your Financial Potential\", \"Regardless of where you choose to put your money\\u2014cash, stocks, bonds, real estate or a combination of places\\u2014the key to saving for retirement is to make your money work for you. It does this through the power of compounding.\", \"The Power of Compounding\", \"Compounding investment earnings is what can make even small investments become larger given enough time. You\\u2019re probably already familiar with the principle of compounding. Money you put into a savings account earns interest. Then you earn interest on the money you originally put in, plus on the interest you\\u2019ve accumulated. As the size of your savings account grows, you earn interest on a bigger and bigger pool of money. \", \"The chart below provides an example of how an investment grows at different annual rates of return over different time periods. Notice how the amount of gain increases each 10-year period. That\\u2019s because money is being earned on a bigger and bigger pool of money.\", \"Compounding\", \"The value of $1,000 compounded at various rates of return over time is as follows:\", \"Also notice that when you double your rate of return from 4 percent to 8 percent, the end result after 30 years is over three times what you would have accumulated with a 4 percent return. That\\u2019s the power of compounding! \", \"The real power of compounding comes with time. The earlier you start saving, the more your money can work for you. Look at it another way. For every 10 years you delay before starting to save for retirement, you will need to save three times as much each month to catch up. That\\u2019s why, no matter how young you are, the sooner you begin saving for retirement, the better.\", \"\\n\", \"Employer Financial Wellness Programs\", \"Does your employer provide a retirement plan? If so, retirement experts say grab it! Employer-based plans are the most effective way to save for your future. What\\u2019s more, you\\u2019ll gain certain tax benefits.\", \"Employer-based plans come in one of two varieties (some employers provide both): defined benefit and defined contribution. \", \"Defined Benefit Plans \", \"These plans pay a lump sum upon retirement or a guaranteed monthly benefit. The amount of payout is typically based on a set formula, such as the number of years you have worked for the employer times a percentage of your highest earnings on the job. Usually the employer funds the plan\\u2014commonly called a traditional pension plan\\u2014though in some plans workers also contribute. Most defined benefit plans are insured by the federal government. \", \"Defined Contribution Plans \", \"The popular 401(k) plan is one type of defined contribution plan. Unlike a defined benefit plan, this type of savings arrangement does not guarantee a specified amount for retirement. Instead, the amount you have available in the plan to help fund your retirement will depend on how long you participate in the plan, how much is invested and how well the investments do over the years. The federal government does not guarantee how much you accumulate in your account, but it does protect the account assets from misuse by the employer.\", \"In the past 20 years, defined contribution plans have become more common than traditional defined benefit retirement plans. Employers fund most types of defined contribution plans, though the amount of their contributions is not necessarily guaranteed. \", \"Workers with a retirement plan are more likely to be covered by a defined contribution plan, usually a 401(k) plan, rather than the traditional defined benefit plan. In many defined contribution plans, you are offered a choice of investment options, and you must decide where to invest your contributions. This shifts much of the responsibility for retirement planning to workers. Thus, it is critical that you choose to contribute to the plan once you become eligible (usually after working full time for a minimum period) and, even if you are automatically enrolled in the plan, to contribute as much as possible. Invest wisely, review your plan investment options and revisit your choices at least once a year. \", \"Tax Breaks \", \"Even though you may be responsible for funding a defined contribution plan, you receive important tax breaks. The money you invest in the plan and the earnings on those contributions are deferred from income tax until you withdraw the money (hopefully not until retirement). Why is that important? Because postponing taxes on what you earn allows your nest egg to grow faster.\", \"Remember the power of compounding? The larger the amount you have to compound, the faster it grows. Even after the withdrawals are taxed, you typically come out ahead. \", \"The tax deduction also means that the decline in your take-home pay, because of your contribution, won\\u2019t be as large as you might think. For example, let\\u2019s assume you are thinking about putting $100 into a retirement plan each month and that the rate you pay on income taxes is 15 percent. If you don\\u2019t put that $100 into a retirement plan, you\\u2019ll pay $15 in taxes on it. If you put in $100, you postpone the taxes. Thus, your $100 retirement plan contribution would actually reduce your take-home pay by only $85. If you\\u2019re in the 25 percent tax bracket, the cost of the $100 contribution is only $75. This is like buying your retirement at a discount. \", \"Vesting Rules \", \"Any money you put into a retirement plan out of your pay, and earnings on those contributions, always belong to you. However, contrary to popular belief, employees don\\u2019t always have immediate access to the money their employer puts into their pension fund or their defined contribution plan. Under some plans, such as a 401(k) or a traditional pension plan, you have to work for a certain number of years\\u2014say, three\\u2014before you become \\u201cvested\\u201d and can receive benefits. Some plans vest in stages. Other defined contribution plans, such as the SEP and the SIMPLE IRA, vest immediately, meaning you have access to the employer\\u2019s contributions the day the money is deposited. No employer can require you to work longer than seven years before you become vested in your retirement benefit.\", \"Be aware of the vesting rules in your employer\\u2019s plan. Make sure you know when you\\u2019re vested. Changing jobs too quickly can mean losing part or all of your retirement benefits or, at the very least, your employer\\u2019s matching contributions. \", \"Retirement Plan Rights \", \"The federal government regulates and monitors company retirement plans.

Investments are made in tax-sheltered annuities or mutual funds. \", \"SIMPLE IRA \", \"The Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees of Small Employers is a simpler type of employer-based retirement plan. There is also a 401(k) version of the SIMPLE.\", \"Profit-sharing Plan \", \"The employer shares company profits with employees, usually based on the level of each employee\\u2019s wages. \", \"ESOP \", \"Employee stock ownership plans are similar to profit-sharing plans, except that an ESOP must invest primarily in company stock. Under an ESOP, the employees share in the ownership of the company. \", \"SEP \", \"Simplified employee pension plans are used by both small employers and the self-employed. \", \"Other retirement plans you may want to learn more about include 457 plans, which cover state and local government workers, and the Federal Thrift Savings Plan, which covers federal employees.

Here are a few suggestions for saving for retirement while financially managing some common life events. \", \"Marriage \", \"Getting married creates new financial demands that compete for retirement dollars, such as changing life insurance needs and saving to buy a home. But it\\u2019s usually less expensive for two people to live together, thus freeing up dollars. A spending plan is essential. Remember, every little bit helps.\", \"Raising children \", \"The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that it costs the average American middle-income family approximately $233,610 to raise a child to age 17. Furthermore, in some cases, a spouse may stay out of the workforce to raise children, thus cutting into income and the opportunity to fund retirement. Having a child may alter your major financial goals, but should never eliminate them. Make the best effort you can. Also, many financial planners stress that saving for retirement should have priority over saving for a child\\u2019s college education. There are financial aid programs for college-bound students but not for retirement.\", \"Changing jobs \", \"It\\u2019s estimated that the average worker changes jobs more than 10 times in a working lifetime. Changing jobs often puts you at risk of not vesting in your current job, or a new job may not offer a retirement plan. Consider keeping your money in your former employer\\u2019s retirement plan or rolling it into a new company plan or an IRA. Don\\u2019t cash out and spend the money, however small the amount. \", \"Divorce \", \"It\\u2019s important that you know the laws regarding your spousal rights to Social Security and retirement benefits. Under current law, spouses and dependents have specific rights. Remember, retirement assets may well be the biggest financial asset in the marriage. Be sure to divide those assets carefully. It\\u2019s also critical to review your overall financial situation before and after your divorce. Income typically drops for partners in the wake of a divorce, particularly for women.\", \"Disability \", \"A severe or long-lasting disability can undermine efforts to save for retirement. Although Social Security disability benefits can help sustain a family if severe disability strikes, you may wish to explore the availability and cost of other forms of disability insurance. \", \"Death \", \"The premature death of a spouse can undermine efforts for the partner to save for retirement, particularly if there are dependent children. That\\u2019s why it\\u2019s important to check your Social Security statement to find out how much children will receive if a parent dies. Maintaining adequate life insurance is also important. Be sure that you have properly named the beneficiaries for any insurance policies, retirement plans, IRAs and other retirement vehicles.\", \"\\n\", \"Staying on Track\", \"Life has a way of throwing unexpected financial roadblocks and detours in our path. These might be in the form of large medical bills, car or home repairs, a death in the family, loss of a job or expensive legal problems.\", \"\", \"Establish an emergency fund \", \"This can lessen the need to dip into retirement savings for a financial emergency. Building an emergency fund is tough if income is tight, but every few dollars help. Fund it with pay from extra working hours or a temporary job, a tax refund or a raise. Put the money into a low-risk, accessible account such as a savings account or a money market fund. \", \"Insure yourself \", \"Insurance protects your financial assets, such as your retirement funds, by helping to take care of the really big financial disasters. Here\\u2019s a list of insurance coverage you should consider buying: \", \"Health\\u2014If you and your family aren\\u2019t covered under an employer\\u2019s policy, consider a health plan through the Health Insurance Marketplace. At least try to buy catastrophic medical coverage on your own. \", \"Disability\\u2014Did you know you are more likely before age 67 to miss work because of a disability than to die? Social Security disability insurance can pay you and your family benefits if you are severely disabled and are expected to be so for at least 12 months. In addition, your employer may offer some disability coverage, but you may need to supplement it with private coverage. \", \"Renters\\u2014Homeowners usually are insured against hazards such as fire, theft and liability, but the majority of renters aren\\u2019t.

It is also illegal in some states to drive without coverage.\", \"Umbrella\\u2014This provides additional liability coverage, usually through your home or auto insurance policies, in the event you face a lawsuit. \", \"Life\\u2014Life insurance can provide financial security to your beneficiaries beyond what Social Security pays. Also, only a spouse, child or parent can receive your Social Security payout, while anyone you designate as a beneficiary can receive the payout of a life insurance policy. There are many types of life insurance, with a variety of fees and commissions attached.\", \"Long-term care\\u2014This insurance can help pay for costly long-term health care either at home, or in a health care facility or nursing home.

Finally, subtract your liabilities from your assets to get your net worth.\", \"Calculating Retirement Savings Worksheet\", \"The Calculating Retirement Savings Worksheet can help you figure out how much you need to save each year toward your goal of a secure retirement. It estimates how much you should save as a percentage of your current annual salary to give you a savings goal. You can save through a retirement savings plan at work, on your own or both. While the worksheet does not take into account your unique circumstances, it will give you an idea of how much to save each year and a clearer picture of your retirement goals. The sooner you start saving, the longer your savings have to grow. \", \"As you fill out the worksheet, think about your plans including when you might retire, what savings you have and how many years you hope to enjoy in retirement. Of course, your plans and circumstances may change, so update this worksheet periodically to reflect any changes. If you are filling this out and are married, consider whether only one spouse is working (either now or in the future) and what will happen to your Social Security and retirement benefits if your spouse dies or you divorce. Use a longer estimate for years in retirement since one spouse is likely to outlive the other. If you and your spouse are both working, but are not close in age, consider filling out separate worksheets with the period of time each spouse has to save. \", \"The worksheet breaks the calculations into four steps.

The worksheet, which uses a 3 percent inflation rate, increases your salary 3 percent each year but does not include any other increases.\", \"Step 1\", \"This step estimates what your annual salary will be at retirement as a result of inflation and how much savings you will need in addition to Social Security for the first year of retirement.

On average, people need to replace about 80 percent of preretirement income for living in retirement. According to the Social Security Administration, Social Security retirement benefits replace about 40 percent of an average wage earner\\u2019s income after retiring. This leaves approximately 40 percent to be replaced by retirement savings. However, keep in mind that this is an estimate.
