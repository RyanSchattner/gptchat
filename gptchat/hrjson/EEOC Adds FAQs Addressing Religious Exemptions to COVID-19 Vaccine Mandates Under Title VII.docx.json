"[\"EEOC Adds FAQs Addressing Religious Objections to COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates Under Title VII\", \"On Oct. 25, 2021, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) issued additional answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) about how employers should comply with Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act (Title VII), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other federal fair employment laws while also observing all applicable emergency workplace safety guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic. \", \"The new FAQs address questions about religious objections to employer COVID-19 vaccine requirements. They were added to the FAQs that the EEOC initially issued on March 18, 2020, and then updated several times. The last major update to this guidance was made in May 2021. The EEOC also made minor updates to some of the Q&As on Oct. 13, 2021. \", \"This Compliance Bulletin contains the EEOC\\u2019s updated FAQs in full. The newly added FAQs about religious exemptions to employer vaccine mandates begin on page 29 of this document. The Q&As that recently received minor updates begin on page 19.  \", \".\", \"\", \"\", \"All employers should follow the most current guidelines and suggestions for maintaining workplace safety, as issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and any applicable state or local health agencies. Employers with 15 or more employees should also become familiar with and follow the guidance provided in the EEOC\\u2019s FAQs about ADA compliance. These and all smaller employers should ensure that they comply with state and local anti-discrimination laws as well. \", \"A. Disability-Related Inquiries and Medical Exams\", \"A.1. How much information may an employer request from an employee who calls in sick, in order to protect the rest of its workforce during the COVID-19 pandemic? \", \"During a pandemic, ADA-covered employers may ask employees if they are experiencing symptoms of the pandemic virus. For COVID-19, these include symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath or sore throat. Employers must maintain all information about employee illness as a confidential medical record in compliance with the ADA.\", \"A.2. (Added April 9, 2020): When screening employees entering the workplace during this time, may an employer only ask employees about the COVID-19 symptoms EEOC has identified as examples, or may it ask about any symptoms identified by public health authorities as associated with COVID-19? \", \"As public health authorities and doctors learn more about COVID-19, they may expand the list of associated symptoms. Employers should rely on the CDC, other public health authorities and reputable medical sources for guidance on emerging symptoms associated with the disease. These sources may guide employers when choosing questions to ask employees to determine whether they would pose a direct threat to health in the workplace. For example, additional symptoms beyond fever or cough may include new loss of smell or taste as well as gastrointestinal problems, such as nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting.\", \"A.3. When may an ADA-covered employer take employees\\u2019 body temperature during the COVID-19 pandemic? \", \"Generally, measuring an employee's body temperature is a medical examination. Because the CDC and state/local health authorities have acknowledged community spread of COVID-19 and issued attendant precautions, employers may measure employees\\u2019 body temperature. However, employers should be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever.\", \"A.4. May employers require employees to stay home if they have COVID-19 symptoms? \", \"Yes. The CDC states that employees who become ill with symptoms of COVID-19 should leave the workplace. The ADA does not interfere with employers following this advice.\", \"A.5. When employees return to work, may an employer require doctors\\u2019 notes certifying their fitness for duty? \", \"Yes. These inquiries are permitted under the ADA either because they would not be disability-related or would be justified under the ADA standards for disability-related inquiries. As a practical matter, however, doctors and other health care professionals may be too busy during and immediately after a pandemic outbreak to provide fitness-for-duty documentation. Therefore, new approaches may be necessary. For example, employers could rely on local clinics to provide a form, stamp or e-mail to certify that an individual does not have the pandemic virus.\", \"A.6. (Added April 23, 2020; Updated Sept. 8, 2020): May an employer administer a COVID-19 test (a test to detect the presence of the COVID-19 virus) when evaluating an employee\\u2019s initial or continued presence in the workplace?\", \"The ADA requires that any mandatory medical test of employees be \\u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity.\\u201d Applying this standard to the current circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic, employers may take steps to determine if employees entering the workplace have COVID-19 because an individual with the virus will pose a direct threat to the health of others. Therefore an employer may choose to administer COVID-19 testing to employees before initially permitting them to enter the workplace and/or periodically to determine if their presence in the workplace poses a direct threat to others. The ADA does not interfere with employers following\\u00a0recommendations by the CDC\\u00a0or other public health authorities regarding whether, when, and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate. Testing administered by employers consistent with current CDC guidance will meet the ADA\\u2019s \\u201cbusiness necessity\\u201d standard.\", \"Consistent with the ADA standard, employers should ensure that the tests are accurate and reliable. For example, employers may review information from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about what may or may not be considered safe and accurate testing, as well as guidance from CDC or other public health authorities. Because the CDC and FDA may revise their recommendations based on new information, it may be helpful to check these agency websites for updates. Employers may wish to consider the incidence of false-positives or false-negatives associated with a particular test. Note that a positive test result reveals that an individual most likely has a current infection and may be able to transmit the virus to others. A negative test means that the individual did not have detectable COVID-19 at the time of testing. \", \"A negative test does not mean the employee will not acquire the virus later. Based on guidance from medical and public health authorities, employers should still require\\u2013to the greatest extent possible\\u2013that employees observe infection control practices (such as social distancing, regular handwashing, and other measures) in the workplace to prevent transmission of COVID-19.\", \"Note: Question A.6 and A.8 address screening of employees generally. See Question A.9 regarding decisions to screen individual employees.\", \"A.7.\\u00a0(Added June 17, 2020): Does the ADA allow an employer to require antibody testing before permitting employees to re-enter the workplace?\\u00a0\", \"No. An antibody test constitutes a medical examination under the ADA.\\u00a0In light of the CDC\\u2019s interim guidelines stating that antibody test results \\u201cshould not be used to make decisions about returning persons to the workplace,\\u201d an antibody test at this time does not meet the ADA\\u2019s \\u201cjob related and consistent with business necessity\\u201d standard for medical examinations or inquiries for current employees.\\u00a0Therefore, requiring antibody testing before allowing employees to re-enter the workplace is not allowed under the ADA. Please note that an antibody test is different from a test to determine if someone has an active case of COVID-19 (that is, a viral test). The EEOC has already stated that COVID-19 viral tests are\\u00a0permissible under the ADA. The EEOC will continue to closely monitor CDC\\u2019s recommendations and could update this discussion in response to changes. \", \"A.8. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): May employers ask all employees physically entering the workplace if they have been diagnosed with or tested for COVID-19? \", \"Yes. Employers may ask all employees who will be physically entering the workplace if they have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19, and ask if they have been tested for COVID-19. Symptoms associated with COVID-19 include, for example, fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath. The CDC has identified a\\u00a0current list of symptoms.\", \"An employer may exclude those with COVID-19, or symptoms associated with COVID-19, from the workplace because, as EEOC has stated, their presence would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others. However, for those employees who are teleworking and are not physically interacting with coworkers or others (for example, customers), the employer would generally not be permitted to ask these questions.\", \"A.9. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): May a manager ask only one employee\\u2014as opposed to asking all employees\\u2014questions designed to determine if she has COVID-19, or require that this employee alone have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing? \", \"If an employer wishes to ask only a particular employee to answer such questions, or to have her temperature taken or undergo other screening or testing, the ADA requires the employer to have a reasonable belief based on objective evidence that this person might have the disease. So, it is important for the employer to consider why it wishes to take these actions regarding this particular employee, such as a display of COVID-19 symptoms. In addition, the ADA does not interfere with employers following\\u00a0recommendations by the CDC\\u00a0or other public health authorities regarding whether, when, and for whom testing or other screening is appropriate.\", \"A.10. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): May an employer ask an employee who is physically coming into the workplace whether they have family members who have COVID-19 or symptoms associated with COVID-19? \", \"No. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prohibits employers from asking employees medical questions about family members. GINA, however, does not prohibit an employer from asking employees whether they have had contact with anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 or who may have symptoms associated with the disease. Moreover, from a public health perspective, only asking an employee about his contact with family members would unnecessarily limit the information obtained about an employee\\u2019s potential exposure to COVID-19.\", \"A.11. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): What may an employer do under the ADA if an employee refuses to permit the employer to take his temperature or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19? \", \"Under the circumstances existing currently, the ADA allows an employer to bar an employee from physical presence in the workplace if he refuses to have his temperature taken or refuses to answer questions about whether he has COVID-19, has symptoms associated with COVID-19, or has been tested for COVID-19. To gain the cooperation of employees, however, employers may wish to ask the reasons for the employee\\u2019s refusal. \", \"The employer may be able to provide information or reassurance that they are taking these steps to ensure the safety of everyone in the workplace, and that these steps are consistent with health screening recommendations from CDC. Sometimes, employees are reluctant to provide medical information because they fear an employer may widely spread such personal medical information throughout the workplace. The ADA prohibits such broad disclosures. \", \"Alternatively, if an employee requests reasonable accommodation with respect to screening, the usual accommodation process should be followed; this is discussed in Question G.7.\", \"A.12. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): During the COVID-19 pandemic, may an employer request information from employees who work on-site, whether regularly or occasionally, who report feeling ill or who call in sick? \", \"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, at this time employers may ask employees who work on-site, whether regularly or occasionally, and report feeling ill or who call in sick, questions about their symptoms as part of workplace screening for COVID-19.\", \"\", \"A.13. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): May an employer ask an employee why he or she has been absent from work? May an employer ask an employee why he or she has been absent from work? \", \"Yes. Asking why an individual did not report to work is not a disability-related inquiry. An employer is always entitled to know why an employee has not reported for work.\", \"A.14. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): When an employee returns from travel during a pandemic, must an employer wait until the employee develops COVID-19 symptoms to ask questions about where the person has traveled?\\u00a0\", \"No. Questions about where a person traveled would not be disability-related inquiries. If the CDC or state or local public health officials recommend that people who visit specified locations remain at home for a certain period of time, an employer may ask whether employees are returning from these locations, even if the travel was personal.\", \"B. Confidentiality of Medical Information\", \"B.1. (Added April 9, 2020): May an employer store in existing medical files information it obtains related to COVID-19, including the results of taking an employee's temperature or the employee's self-identification as having this disease, or must the employer create a new medical file system solely for this information? \", \"The ADA requires that all medical information about a particular employee be stored separately from the employee's personnel file, thus limiting access to this confidential information. An employer may store all medical information related to COVID-19 in existing medical files. This includes an employee's statement that he has the disease or suspects he has the disease, or the employer's notes or other documentation from questioning an employee about symptoms. \", \"B.2. (Added April 9, 2020): If an employer requires all employees to have a daily temperature check before entering the workplace, may the employer maintain a log of the results? \", \"Yes. The employer needs to maintain the confidentiality of this information.\", \"B.3. (Added April 9, 2020): May an employer disclose the name of an employee to a public health agency when it learns that the employee has COVID-19?\", \"Yes. \", \"B.4. (Added April 9, 2020): May a temporary staffing agency or a contractor that places an employee in an employer's workplace notify the employer if it learns the employee has COVID-19? \", \"Yes. The staffing agency or contractor may notify the employer and disclose the name of the employee, because the employer may need to determine if this employee had contact with anyone in the workplace.\", \"B.5. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): Suppose a manager learns that an employee has COVID-19, or has symptoms associated with the disease. The manager knows she must report it but is worried about violating ADA confidentiality. What should she do?\\u00a0\", \"The ADA requires that an employer keep all medical information about employees confidential, even if that information is not about a disability. Clearly, the information that an employee has symptoms of, or a diagnosis of, COVID-19, is medical information. But the fact that this is medical information does not prevent the manager from reporting to appropriate employer officials so that they can take actions consistent with guidance from the CDC and other public health authorities.\", \"The question is really what information to report: is it the fact that an employee\\u2014unnamed\\u2014has symptoms of COVID-19 or a diagnosis, or is it the identity of that employee? Who in the organization needs to know the identity of the employee will depend on each workplace and why a specific official needs this information. Employers should make every effort to limit the number of people who get to know the name of the employee.\", \"The ADA does not interfere with a designated representative of the employer interviewing the employee to get a list of people with whom the employee possibly had contact through the workplace, so that the employer can then take action to notify those who may have come into contact with the employee, without revealing the employee\\u2019s identity.\\u00a0For example, using a generic descriptor, such as telling employees that \\u201csomeone at this location\\u201d or \\u201csomeone on the fourth floor\\u201d has COVID-19, provides notice and does not violate the ADA\\u2019s prohibition of disclosure of confidential medical information.\\u00a0\", \"For small employers, coworkers might be able to figure out who the employee is, but employers in that situation are still prohibited from confirming or revealing the employee\\u2019s identity. Also, all employer officials who are designated as needing to know the identity of an employee should be specifically instructed that they must maintain the confidentiality of this information. Employers may want to plan in advance what supervisors and managers should do if this situation arises and determine who will be responsible for receiving information and taking next steps.\", \"B.6.\\u00a0(Added Sept. 8, 2020): An employee who must report to the workplace knows that a coworker who reports to the same workplace has symptoms associated with COVID-19. Does ADA confidentiality prevent the first employee from disclosing the coworker's symptoms to a supervisor?\\u00a0\", \"No. ADA confidentiality does not prevent this employee from communicating to his supervisor about a coworker\\u2019s symptoms. In other words, it is not an ADA confidentiality violation for this employee to inform his supervisor about a coworker\\u2019s symptoms. After learning about this situation, the supervisor should contact appropriate management officials to report this information and discuss next steps.\", \"B.7.\\u00a0(Added Sept. 8, 2020): An employer knows that an employee is teleworking because the person has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, and that he is in self-quarantine. May the employer tell staff that this particular employee is teleworking without saying why?\\u00a0\", \"Yes. If staff need to know how to contact the employee, and that the employee is working even if not present in the workplace, then disclosure that the employee is teleworking without saying why is permissible. Also, if the employee was on leave rather than teleworking because he has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with the disease, or any other medical condition, then an employer cannot disclose the reason for the leave, just the fact that the individual is on leave.\", \"B.8. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): Many employees, including managers and supervisors, are now teleworking as a result of COVID-19. How are they supposed to keep medical information of employees confidential while working remotely?\\u00a0\", \"The ADA requirement that medical information be kept confidential includes a requirement that it be stored separately from regular personnel files. If a manager or supervisor receives medical information involving COVID-19, or any other medical information, while teleworking, and is able to follow an employer\\u2019s existing confidentiality protocols while working remotely, the supervisor has to do so. But to the extent that is not feasible, the supervisor still must safeguard this information to the greatest extent possible until the supervisor can properly store it. This means that paper notepads, laptops, or other devices should not be left where others can access the protected information.\", \"Similarly, documentation must not be stored electronically where others would have access. A manager may even wish to use initials or another code to further ensure confidentiality of the name of an employee.\", \"C. Hiring and Onboarding\", \"C.1. If an employer is hiring, may it screen applicants for COVID-19 symptoms? \", \"Yes. An employer may screen job applicants for symptoms of COVID-19 after making a conditional job offer, as long as it does so for all entering employees in the same type of job. This ADA rule applies regardless of whether the applicant has a disability.\", \"C.2. May an employer take an applicant\\u2019s temperature as part of a post-offer, pre-employment medical exam? \", \"Yes. Any medical exams are permitted after an employer has made a conditional offer of employment. However, employers should be aware that some people with COVID-19 do not have a fever.\", \"C.3. May an employer delay the start date of an applicant who has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it? \", \"Yes. According to current CDC guidance, an individual who has COVID-19 or symptoms associated with it should not be in the workplace.\", \"C.4. May an employer withdraw a job offer when it needs the applicant to start immediately but the individual has COVID-19 or symptoms of it? \", \"Based on current CDC guidance, this individual cannot safely enter the workplace. Therefore, the employer may withdraw the job offer.\", \"C.5. (Added April 9, 2020): May an employer postpone the start date or withdraw a job offer because the individual is 65 years old or pregnant, both of which place them at higher risk from COVID-19? \", \"No. The fact that the CDC has identified those who are 65 or older, or pregnant women, as being at greater risk does not justify unilaterally postponing the start date or withdrawing a job offer. However, an employer may choose to allow telework or to discuss with these individuals if they would like to postpone the start date.\", \"D. Reasonable Accommodation\", \"In discussing accommodation requests, employers and employees may find it helpful to consult the Job Accommodation Network (JAN) website for types of accommodations. JAN's materials specific to COVID-19 are available here.\", \"D.1. (Added April 9, 2020): If a job may only be performed at the workplace, are there reasonable accommodations for individuals with disabilities absent undue hardship that could offer protection to an employee who, due to a preexisting disability, is at higher risk from COVID-19? \", \"There may be reasonable accommodations that could offer protection to an individual whose disability puts him at greater risk from COVID-19 and who therefore requests such actions to eliminate possible exposure. Even with the constraints imposed by a pandemic, some accommodations may meet an employee's needs on a temporary basis without causing undue hardship on the employer. \", \"Low-cost solutions achieved with materials already on hand or easily obtained may be effective. If not already implemented for all employees, accommodations for those who request reduced contact with others due to a disability may include changes to the work environment such as designating one-way aisles; using plexiglass, tables, or other barriers to ensure minimum distances between customers and coworkers whenever feasible per CDC guidance or other accommodations that reduce chances of exposure.\", \"Flexibility by employers and employees is important in determining if some accommodation is possible in the circumstances. Temporary job restructuring of marginal job duties, temporary transfers to a different position, or modifying a work schedule or shift assignment may also permit an individual with a disability to perform safely the essential functions of the job while reducing exposure to others in the workplace or while commuting. \", \"D.2. (Added April 9, 2020): If an employee has a preexisting mental illness or disorder that has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, may he now be entitled to a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship)? \", \"Although many people feel significant stress due to the COVID-19 pandemic, employees with certain preexisting mental health conditions, for example, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder, may have more difficulty handling the disruption to daily life that has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. \", \"As with any accommodation request, employers may: \", \"Ask questions to determine whether the condition is a disability; \", \"Discuss with the employee how the requested accommodation would assist him and enable him to keep working; \", \"Explore alternative accommodations that may effectively meet his needs; and \", \"Request medical documentation if needed. \", \"D.3. (Added April 9, 2020): In a workplace where all employees are required to telework during this time, should an employer postpone discussing a request from an employee with a disability for an accommodation that will not be needed until he returns to the workplace when mandatory telework ends? \", \"Not necessarily. An employer may give higher priority to discussing requests for reasonable accommodations that are needed while teleworking, but the employer may begin discussing this request now. The employer may be able to acquire all the information it needs to make a decision. If a reasonable accommodation is granted, the employer also may be able to make some arrangements for the accommodation in advance.\", \"D.4. (Added April 9, 2020): What if an employee was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and now requests an additional or altered accommodation? \", \"An employee who was already receiving a reasonable accommodation prior to the COVID-19 pandemic may be entitled to an additional or altered accommodation, absent undue hardship. For example, an employee who is teleworking because of the pandemic may need a different type of accommodation than what he uses in the workplace. The employer may discuss with the employee whether the same or a different disability is the basis for this new request and why an additional or altered accommodation is needed.\", \"D.5. (Added April 17, 2020): During the pandemic, if an employee requests an accommodation for a medical condition either at home or in the workplace, may an employer still request information to determine if the condition is a disability?\", \"Yes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request medical documentation to determine whether the employee has a \\u201cdisability\\u201d as defined by the ADA (a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, or a history of a substantially limiting impairment).\", \"D.6. (Added April 17, 2020): During the pandemic, may an employer still engage in the interactive process and request information from an employee about why an accommodation is needed?\", \"Yes, if it is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask questions or request medical documentation to determine whether the employee\\u2019s disability necessitates an accommodation, either the one he or she requested or any other. Possible questions for the employee may include:\", \"How the disability creates a limitation; \", \"How the requested accommodation will effectively address the limitation;\", \"Whether another form of accommodation could effectively address the issue; and\", \"How a proposed accommodation will enable the employee to continue performing the \\u201cessential functions\\u201d of his or her position (the fundamental job duties). \", \"D.7. (Added April 17, 2020): If there is some urgency to providing an accommodation, or the employer has limited time available to discuss the request during the pandemic, may an employer provide a temporary accommodation? \", \"Yes. Given the pandemic, some employers may choose to forgo or shorten the exchange of information between an employer and employee, which is known as the \\u201cinteractive process,\\u201d and grant the request. In addition, when government restrictions change or are partially or fully lifted, the need for accommodations may also change. This may result in more requests for short-term accommodations. Employers may wish to adapt the interactive process\\u2014and devise end dates for the accommodation\\u2014to suit changing circumstances based on public health directives.\", \"Whatever the reason for shortening or adapting the interactive process, an employer may also choose to place an end date on the accommodation (for example, either a specific date such as May 30, or when the employee returns to the workplace on a part- or full-time basis due to changes in government restrictions limiting the number of people who may congregate). \", \"Employers may also opt to provide a requested accommodation on an interim or trial basis, with an end date, while awaiting receipt of medical documentation. Choosing one of these alternatives may be particularly helpful where the requested accommodation would provide protection that an employee may need because of a pre-existing disability that puts him or her at greater risk during the pandemic. This could also apply to employees who have disabilities exacerbated by the pandemic.\", \"Employees may request an extension that an employer must consider, particularly if current government restrictions are extended or new ones adopted. \", \"\", \"D.8. (Added April 17, 2020; Updated Sept. 8, 2020): May an employer ask employees now if they will need reasonable accommodations in the future when they are permitted to return to the workplace? \", \"Yes. Employers may inform the workforce that employees with disabilities may request accommodations in advance that they believe they may need when the workplace re-opens. This is discussed in greater detail in Question G.6. If advance requests are received, employers may begin the \\u201cinteractive process\\u201d \\u2013 the discussion between the employer and employee focused on whether the impairment is a disability and the reasons that an accommodation is needed. If an employee chooses not to request accommodation in advance, and instead requests it at a later time, the employer must still consider the request at that time.\", \"D.9. (Added April 17, 2020): Are the circumstances of the pandemic relevant to whether a requested accommodation can be denied because it poses an undue hardship? \", \"Yes. An employer does not have to provide a particular reasonable accommodation if it poses an undue hardship, which means \\u201csignificant difficulty or expense.\\u201d In some instances, an accommodation that would not have posed an undue hardship prior to the pandemic may pose one now.\", \"D.10. (Added April 17, 2020): What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses \\u201csignificant difficulty\\u201d during the COVID-19 pandemic? \", \"An employer may consider whether current circumstances create \\u201csignificant difficulty\\u201d in acquiring or providing certain accommodations, in light of the facts of the particular job and workplace. For example, it may be significantly more difficult in the pandemic to conduct a needs assessment or to acquire certain items, and delivery may be impacted, particularly for employees who may be teleworking. Or, it may be significantly more difficult to provide employees with temporary assignments, to remove marginal functions or to readily hire temporary workers for specialized positions. If a particular accommodation poses an undue hardship, employers and employees should work together to determine if there may be an alternative that could be provided that does not pose such problems. \", \"D.11. (Added April 17, 2020): What types of undue hardship considerations may be relevant to determine if a requested accommodation poses \\u201csignificant expense\\u201d during the COVID-19 pandemic?\", \"Prior to the pandemic, most accommodations did not pose a significant expense when considered against an employer\\u2019s overall budget and resources (always considering the budget and resources of the entire entity and not just its components). However, the sudden loss of some or all of an employer\\u2019s income stream because of the pandemic is a relevant consideration. \", \"Also relevant is the amount of discretionary funds available at this time (when considering other expenses) and whether there is an expected date that current restrictions on an employer\\u2019s operations will be lifted (or new restrictions will be added or substituted). These considerations do not mean that an employer can reject any accommodation that costs money; an employer must weigh the cost of an accommodation against its current budget while taking into account constraints created by the pandemic. For example, even under current circumstances, there may be many no-cost or very low-cost accommodations. \", \"\", \"D.12. (Added April 23, 2020): Do the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act apply to applicants or employees who are classified as \\u201ccritical infrastructure workers\\u201d or \\u201cessential critical workers\\u201d by the CDC?\\u00a0\", \"Yes. These CDC designations, or any other designations of certain employees, do not eliminate coverage under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act, or any other equal employment opportunity law. Therefore, employers receiving requests for reasonable accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act from employees falling in these categories of jobs must accept and process the requests as they would for any other employee. Whether the request is granted will depend on whether the worker is an individual with a disability, and whether there is a reasonable accommodation that can be provided absent undue hardship.\", \"D.13. (Added June 11, 2020): Is an employee entitled to an accommodation under the ADA in order to avoid exposing a family member who is at higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19 due to an underlying medical condition?\\u00a0\", \"No. Although the ADA prohibits discrimination based on association with an individual with a disability, that protection is limited to disparate treatment or harassment. The ADA does not require that an employer accommodate an employee without a disability based on the disability-related needs of a family member or other person with whom she is associated.\\u00a0\", \"For example, an employee without a disability is not entitled under the ADA to telework as an accommodation in order to protect a family member with a disability from potential COVID-19 exposure.\\u00a0\", \"Of course, an employer is free to provide such flexibilities if it chooses to do so. An employer choosing to offer additional flexibilities beyond what the law requires should be careful not to engage in disparate treatment on a protected trait.\", \"D.14. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): When an employer requires some or all of its employees to telework because of COVID-19 or government officials require employers to shut down their facilities and have workers telework, is the employer required to provide a teleworking employee with the same reasonable accommodations for disability under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act that it provides to this individual in the workplace?\", \"If such a request is made, the employer and employee should discuss what the employee needs and why, and whether the same or a different accommodation could suffice in the home setting. For example, an employee may already have certain things in their home to enable them to do their job so that they do not need to have all of the accommodations that are provided in the workplace.\", \"Also, the undue hardship considerations might be different when evaluating a request for accommodation when teleworking rather than working in the workplace. A reasonable accommodation that is feasible and does not pose an undue hardship in the workplace might pose one when considering circumstances, such as the place where it is needed and the reason for telework. For example, the fact that the period of telework may be of a temporary or unknown duration may render certain accommodations either not feasible or an undue hardship. There may also be constraints on the normal availability of items or on the ability of an employer to conduct a necessary assessment.\", \"As a practical matter, and in light of the circumstances that led to the need for telework, employers and employees should both be creative and flexible about what can be done when an employee needs a reasonable accommodation for telework at home. If possible, providing interim accommodations might be appropriate while an employer discusses a request with the employee or is waiting for additional information.\", \"D.15. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): Assume that an employer grants telework to employees for the purpose of slowing or stopping the spread of COVID-19. When an employer reopens the workplace and recalls employees to the worksite, does the employer automatically have to grant telework as a reasonable accommodation to every employee with a disability who requests to continue this arrangement as an ADA/Rehabilitation Act accommodation? \", \"No. Any time an employee requests a reasonable accommodation, the employer is entitled to understand the disability-related limitation that necessitates an accommodation. If there is no disability-related limitation that requires teleworking, then the employer does not have to provide telework as an accommodation. Or, if there is a disability-related limitation but the employer can effectively address the need with another form of reasonable accommodation at the workplace, then the employer can choose that alternative to telework.\", \"To the extent that an employer is permitting telework to employees because of COVID-19 and is choosing to excuse an employee from performing one or more essential functions, then a request\\u2014after the workplace reopens\\u2014to continue telework as a reasonable accommodation does not have to be granted if it requires continuing to excuse the employee from performing an essential function. The ADA never requires an employer to eliminate an essential function as an accommodation for an individual with a disability.\\u00a0\", \"The fact that an employer temporarily excused performance of one or more essential functions when it closed the workplace and enabled employees to telework for the purpose of protecting their safety from COVID-19, or otherwise chose to permit telework, does not mean that the employer permanently changed a job\\u2019s essential functions, that telework is always a feasible accommodation, or that it does not pose an undue hardship. These are fact-specific determinations. The employer has no obligation under the ADA to refrain from restoring all of an employee\\u2019s essential duties at such time as it chooses to restore the prior work arrangement, and then evaluating any requests for continued or new accommodations under the usual ADA rules.\", \"D.16. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): Assume that prior to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, an employee with a disability had requested telework as a reasonable accommodation. The employee had shown a disability-related need for this accommodation, but the employer denied it because of concerns that the employee would not be able to perform the essential functions remotely. In the past, the employee therefore continued to come to the workplace. However, after the COVID-19 crisis has subsided and temporary telework ends, the employee renews her request for telework as a reasonable accommodation. Can the employer again refuse the request?\\u00a0\", \"Assuming all the requirements for such a reasonable accommodation are satisfied, the temporary telework experience could be relevant to considering the renewed request. In this situation, for example, the period of providing telework because of the COVID-19 pandemic could serve as a trial period that showed whether or not this employee with a disability could satisfactorily perform all essential functions while working remotely, and the employer should consider any new requests in light of this information. As with all accommodation requests, the employee and the employer should engage in a flexible, cooperative interactive process going forward if this issue does arise.\", \"D.17. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): Might the pandemic result in excusable delays during the interactive process?\\u00a0\", \"Yes. The rapid spread of COVID-19 has disrupted normal work routines and may have resulted in unexpected or increased requests for reasonable accommodation.\\u00a0Although employers and employees should address these requests as soon as possible, the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in delay in discussing requests and in providing accommodation where warranted.\\u00a0Employers and employees are encouraged to use interim solutions to enable employees to keep working as much as possible.\", \"D.18. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): Federal agencies are required to have timelines in their written reasonable accommodation procedures governing how quickly they will process requests and provide reasonable accommodations. What happens if circumstances created by the pandemic prevent an agency from meeting this timeline?\\u00a0\", \"Situations created by the current COVID-19 crisis may constitute an \\u201cextenuating circumstance\\u201d\\u2014something beyond a Federal agency\\u2019s control\\u2014that may justify exceeding the normal timeline that an agency has adopted in its internal reasonable accommodation procedures.\\u00a0\", \"E.

(Added April 17, 2020): Are there steps an employer should take to address possible harassment and discrimination against coworkers when it re-opens the workplace? \", \"Yes. An employer may remind all employees that it is against the federal EEO laws to harass or otherwise discriminate against coworkers based on race, national origin, color, sex, religion, age (40 or over), disability or genetic information. It may be particularly helpful for employers to advise supervisors and managers of their roles in watching for, stopping and reporting any harassment or other discrimination. An employer may also make clear that it will immediately review any allegations of harassment or discrimination and take appropriate action.\", \"E.3. (Added June 11, 2020): How may employers respond to pandemic-related harassment, in particular against employees who are or are perceived to be Asian?\", \"Managers should be alert to demeaning, derogatory, or hostile remarks directed to employees who are or are perceived to be of Chinese or other Asian national origin, including about the coronavirus or its origins.\", \"All employers covered by Title VII should ensure that management understands in advance how to recognize such harassment. Harassment may occur using electronic communication tools \\u2013 regardless of whether employees are in the workplace, teleworking, or on leave \\u2013 and also in person between employees at the worksite. Harassment of employees at the worksite may also originate with contractors, customers or clients, or, for example, with patients or their family members at health care facilities, assisted living facilities, and nursing homes. Managers should know their legal obligations and be\\u00a0instructed\\u00a0to quickly identify and resolve potential problems, before they rise to the level of unlawful discrimination.\", \"Employers may choose to send a reminder to the entire workforce noting Title VII\\u2019s prohibitions on harassment, reminding employees that harassment will not be tolerated, and inviting anyone who experiences or witnesses workplace harassment to report it to management. Employers may remind employees that harassment can result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.\", \"E.4. (Added June 11, 2020): An employer learns that an employee who is teleworking due to the pandemic is sending harassing emails to another worker. What actions should the employer take?\\u00a0\", \"The employer should take the same actions it would take if the employee was in the workplace. Employees may not harass other employees through, for example, emails, calls, or platforms for video or chat communication and collaboration.\\u00a0\", \"F. Furloughs and Layoffs\", \"F.1. (Added April 9, 2020): Under the EEOC's laws, what waiver responsibilities apply when an employer is conducting layoffs? \", \"Special rules apply when an employer is offering employees severance packages in exchange for a general release of all discrimination claims against the employer. More information is available in EEOC\\u2019s technical assistance document on severance agreements.\", \"F.2. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): What are additional EEO considerations in planning furloughs or layoffs?\\u00a0\", \"The laws enforced by the EEOC prohibit covered employers from selecting people for furlough or layoff because of that individual\\u2019s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, age, disability, protected genetic information, or in retaliation for protected EEO activity.\", \"G. Return to Work\", \"G.1. (Added April 17, 2020): As government stay-at-home orders and other restrictions are modified or lifted in your area, how will employers know what steps they can take consistent with the ADA to screen employees for COVID-19 when entering the workplace? \", \"The ADA permits employers to make disability-related inquiries and conduct medical exams if job-related and consistent with business necessity. Inquiries and reliable medical exams meet this standard if it is necessary to exclude employees with a medical condition that would pose a direct threat to health or safety.\", \"Direct threat is to be determined based on the best available objective medical evidence. The guidance from CDC or other public health authorities is such evidence. Therefore, employers will be acting consistent with the ADA as long as any screening implemented is consistent with advice from the CDC and public health authorities for that type of workplace at that time. \", \"For example, this may include continuing to take temperatures and asking questions about symptoms (or require self-reporting) of all those entering the workplace. Similarly, the CDC recently posted information on return by certain types of critical workers. \", \"Employers should make sure not to engage in unlawful disparate treatment based on protected characteristics in decisions related to screening and exclusion.\", \"G.2. (Added April 17, 2020): An employer requires returning workers to wear personal protective gear and engage in infection control practices. Some employees ask for accommodations due to a need for modified protective gear. Must an employer grant these requests?\", \"An employer may require employees to wear protective gear (for example, masks and gloves) and observe infection control practices (for example, regular hand washing and social distancing protocols). \", \"However, where an employee with a disability needs a related reasonable accommodation under the ADA (such as non-latex gloves, modified face masks for interpreters or others who communicate with an employee who uses lip reading, or gowns designed for individuals who use wheelchairs), or a religious accommodation under Title VII (such as modified equipment due to religious garb), the employer should discuss the request and provide the modification or an alternative if feasible and not an undue hardship on the operation of the employer\\u2019s business under the ADA or Title VII. \", \"G.3. (Added May 7, 2020): What does an employee need to do in order to request reasonable accommodation from his or her employer because he or she has one of the medical conditions that CDC says may put him or her at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19?\", \"An employee \\u2013 or a third party, such as an employee\\u2019s doctor \\u2013 must let the employer know that he or she needs a change for a reason related to a medical condition (here, the underlying condition). Individuals may request accommodation in conversation or in writing. While the employee (or third party) does not need to use the term \\u201creasonable accommodation\\u201d or reference the ADA, he or she may do so.\", \"The employee (or his or her representative) should communicate that he or she has a medical condition that necessitates a change to meet a medical need. After receiving a request, the employer may ask questions or seek medical documentation to help decide if the individual has a disability and if there is a reasonable accommodation, barring undue hardship, that can be provided.\", \"G.4. (Added May 7, 2020): The CDC identifies a number of medical conditions that might place individuals at \\u201chigher risk for severe illness\\u201d if they get COVID-19. An employer knows that an employee has one of these conditions and is concerned that his or her health will be jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, but the employee has not requested accommodation. How does the ADA apply to this situation?\", \"First, if the employee does not request a reasonable accommodation, the ADA does not mandate that the employer take action.\", \"If the employer is concerned about the employee\\u2019s health being jeopardized upon returning to the workplace, the ADA does not allow the employer to exclude the employee \\u2013 or take any other adverse action \\u2013solely because the employee has a disability that the CDC identifies as potentially placing him at \\u201chigher risk for severe illness\\u201d if he gets COVID-19. Under the ADA, such action is not allowed unless the employee\\u2019s disability poses a \\u201cdirect threat\\u201d to his health that cannot be eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation.\", \"The ADA direct threat requirement is a high standard. As an affirmative defense, direct threat requires an employer to show that the individual has a disability that poses a \\u201csignificant risk of substantial harm\\u201d to his own health under federal regulations. A direct threat assessment cannot be based solely on the condition being on the CDC\\u2019s list; the determination must be an individualized assessment based on a reasonable medical judgment about this employee\\u2019s disability \\u2013 not the disability in general \\u2013 using the most current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence. \", \"The ADA regulation requires an employer to consider the duration of the risk, the nature and severity of the potential harm, the likelihood that the potential harm will occur, and the imminence of the potential harm. Analysis of these factors will likely include considerations based on the severity of the pandemic in a particular area and the employee\\u2019s own health (for example, is the employee\\u2019s disability well-controlled), and his or her particular job duties. A determination of direct threat also would include the likelihood that an individual will be exposed to the virus at the worksite. Measures that an employer may be taking in general to protect all workers, such as mandatory social distancing, also would be relevant.\", \"Even if an employer determines that an employee\\u2019s disability poses a direct threat to his or her own health, the employer still cannot exclude the employee from the workplace \\u2013 or take any other adverse action \\u2013 unless there is no way to provide a reasonable accommodation (absent undue hardship). The ADA regulations require an employer to consider whether there are reasonable accommodations that would eliminate or reduce the risk so that it would be safe for the employee to return to the workplace while still permitting performance of essential functions. This can involve an interactive process with the employee. If there are not accommodations that permit this, then an employer must consider accommodations such as telework, leave or reassignment (perhaps to a different job in a place where it may be safer for the employee to work or that permits telework). An employer may only bar an employee from the workplace if, after going through all these steps, the facts support the conclusion that the employee poses a significant risk of substantial harm to himself that cannot be reduced or eliminated by reasonable accommodation.\", \"G.5. (Added May 7, 2020): What are examples of accommodation that, absent undue hardship, may eliminate (or reduce to an acceptable level) a direct threat to self? \", \"Accommodations may include additional or enhanced protective gowns, masks, gloves or other gear beyond what the employer may generally provide to employees returning to its workplace. Accommodations also may include additional or enhanced protective measures (for example, erecting a barrier that provides separation between an employee with a disability and coworkers or the public or increasing the space between an employee with a disability and others).\", \"Another possible reasonable accommodation may be elimination or substitution of particular \\u201cmarginal\\u201d functions (less critical or incidental job duties as distinguished from the \\u201cessential\\u201d functions of a particular position). In addition, accommodations may include temporary modification of work schedules (if that decreases contact with coworkers or the public when on duty or commuting) or moving the location of where one performs work (for example, moving a person to the end of a production line rather than in the middle of it, if that provides more social distancing).\", \"These are only a few ideas. Identifying an effective accommodation depends, among other things, on an employee\\u2019s job duties and the design of the workspace. An employer and employee should discuss possible ideas. \", \"The Job Accommodation Network also may be able to assist in helping identify possible accommodations. As with all discussions of reasonable accommodation during this pandemic, employers and employees are encouraged to be creative and flexible.\", \"G.6. (Added June 11, 2020): As a best practice, and in advance of having some or all employees return to the workplace, are there ways for an employer to invite employees to request flexibility in work arrangements?\\u00a0\", \"Yes. The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act permit employers to make information available in advance to\\u00a0all\\u00a0employees about who to contact\\u2014if they wish\\u2014to request accommodation for a disability that they may need upon return to the workplace, even if no date has been announced for their return. If requests are received in advance, the employer may begin the\\u00a0interactive process. An employer may choose to include in such a notice all the CDC-listed medical conditions that may place people at higher risk of serious illness if they contract COVID-19, provide instructions about who to contact, and explain that the employer is willing to consider on a case-by-case basis any requests from employees who have these or other medical conditions.\\u00a0\", \"An employer also may send a general notice to all employees who are designated for returning to the workplace, noting that the employer is willing to consider requests for accommodation or flexibilities on an individualized basis. The employer should specify if the contacts differ depending on the reason for the request \\u2013 for example, if the office or person to contact is different for employees with disabilities or pregnant workers than for employees whose request is based on age or child-care responsibilities.\", \"Either approach is consistent with the ADEA, the ADA, and the CDC guidance\\u00a0dated May 29, 2020, that emphasizes the importance of employers providing accommodations or flexibilities to employees who, due to age or certain medical conditions, are at higher risk for severe illness.\", \"Regardless of the approach, however, employers should ensure that whoever receives inquiries knows how to handle them consistent with the different federal employment nondiscrimination laws that may apply, for instance, with respect to accommodations due to a medical condition, a religious belief, or pregnancy.\", \"G.7. (Added June 11, 2020): What should an employer do if an employee entering the worksite requests an alternative method of screening due to a medical condition?\\u00a0\", \"This is a request for reasonable accommodation, and an employer should proceed as it would for any other request for accommodation under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act. If the requested change is easy to provide and inexpensive, the employer might voluntarily choose to make it available to anyone who asks, without going through an interactive process. \", \"Alternatively, if the disability is not obvious or already known, an employer may ask the employee for information to establish that the condition is a\\u00a0disability\\u00a0and what specific limitations require an accommodation. If necessary, an employer also may request medical documentation to support the employee\\u2019s request, and then determine if that accommodation or an alternative effective accommodation can be provided, absent undue hardship.\", \"Similarly, if an employee requested an alternative method of screening as a religious accommodation, the employer should determine if accommodation is\\u00a0available under Title VII.\", \"H. Age\", \"H.1.

Do employees age 65 and over have protections under the federal employment discrimination laws?\", \"The Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits employment discrimination against individuals age 40 and older. The ADEA would prohibit a covered employer from involuntarily excluding an individual from the workplace based on his or her being 65 or older, even if the employer acted for benevolent reasons such as protecting the employee due to higher risk of severe illness from COVID-19.\", \"Unlike the ADA, the ADEA does not include a right to reasonable accommodation for older workers due to age.\\u00a0However, employers are free to provide flexibility to workers age 65 and older; the ADEA does not prohibit this, even if it results in younger workers ages 40-64 being treated less favorably based on age in comparison.\\u00a0\", \"Workers age 65 and older also may have medical conditions that bring them under the protection of the ADA as individuals with disabilities. As such, they may request reasonable\\u00a0accommodation for their disability\\u00a0as opposed to their age.\", \"H.2. (Added Sept. 8, 2020): If an employer is choosing to offer flexibilities to other workers, may older comparable workers be treated less favorably based on age?\\u00a0\", \"No. If an employer is allowing other comparable workers to telework, it should make sure it is not treating older workers less favorably based on their age.\", \"I. Caregivers/Family Responsibilities\", \"I.1.

The factors that make up this assessment are: (1) the duration of the risk; (2) the nature and severity of the potential harm; (3) the likelihood that the potential harm will occur; and (4) the imminence of the potential harm. \", \"The determination that a particular employee poses a direct threat should be based on a reasonable medical judgment that relies on the most current medical knowledge about COVID-19.

(Added Oct. 25, 2021) If an employer grants a religious accommodation to an employee, can the employer later reconsider it?\\u00a0\", \"The obligation to provide religious accommodations absent undue hardship is a continuing obligation that takes into account changing circumstances.\\u00a0Employees\\u2019 religious beliefs and practices may evolve or change over time and may result in requests for additional or different religious accommodations.\\u00a0Similarly, an employer has the right to discontinue a previously granted accommodation if it is no longer utilized for religious purposes, or if a provided accommodation subsequently poses an undue hardship on the employer\\u2019s operations due to changed circumstances.
