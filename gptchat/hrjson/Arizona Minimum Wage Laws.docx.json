The Arizona Minimum Wage Act (AMWA) complements federal law and, in some cases, prescribes more stringent or additional requirements that employers must follow.

This rate, also known as the cash wage, is calculated by subtracting $3 tip credit from the current state minimum wage rate. \", \"The law allows employers to use a $3 per hour tip credit of because it assumes that an employee\\u2019s tips will be sufficient to enable the employee to receive wages at or above the minimum wage rate. Employers that want to use the tip credit must notify their employees in writing and upon hire that their wages are calculated using tips, a tip credit and a cash wage. Employers must subsidize a tipped employee\\u2019s wages each time his or her tips are insufficient to meet minimum wage requirements. \", \"A tipped employee is an individual who is engaged in an occupation in which tips or gratuities are customarily exchanged for services. Tip credit provisions are available to tipped employees only during the hours they actually work in a tipped occupation.

In addition, employers must notify their employees in writing upon hiring of the employer\\u2019s business name, address and telephone number.\", \"Retaliation\", \"The ICA presumes that employers retaliate against an employee if they discharge, terminate, discipline or otherwise take an adverse action within 90 days of when an employee files a complaint, assists the ICA in a wage investigation or informs another person of his or her rights. Employers that retaliate against their employees may be ordered to pay fine of at least $150 for each day the retaliation continues or until a legal judgment is final. \", \"Penalties\", \"Employers that violate the AMWA are subject to a civil penalty of at least: \", \"$250 for a first violation; and\", \"$1,000 for subsequent or willful violations.\", \"In addition, employees can recover unpaid wages, interest on any unpaid wages and an additional amount equal to twice the amount of unpaid wages, reasonable attorney\\u2019s fees and court costs.
