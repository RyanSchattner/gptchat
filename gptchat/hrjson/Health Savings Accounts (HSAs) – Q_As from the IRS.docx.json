"[\"Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)\\u2014Q&As from the IRS\", \"Many employers offer high-deductible health plans (HDHPs) to control premium costs, and then pair this coverage with health savings accounts (HSAs) to help employees with their health care expenses. An HSA is a tax-favored trust or account that can be contributed to by, or on behalf of, an eligible individual for the purpose of paying qualified medical expenses.\", \"HSAs provide a triple tax advantage\\u2014contributions, investment earnings and amounts distributed for qualified medical expenses are all exempt from federal income tax, FICA tax and most state income taxes. Due to an HSA\\u2019s potential tax savings, federal tax law imposes strict requirements for HSA eligibility, contributions and distributions.\", \" The basic rules for HSAs are contained in Internal Revenue Code (Code) Section 223. Since Code Section 223 was enacted in 2003, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued guidance on HSAs, mainly in the format of questions and answers (Q&As). This Compliance Overview includes key compliance Q&As that the IRS has issued on HSAs, with updates for current cost-of-living adjustments.\", \"\", \"plans are enforced. \", \"Eligibility\", \"Who is eligible to establish an HSA?\", \"An \\u201celigible individual\\u201d can establish an HSA. An \\u201celigible individual\\u201d means, with respect to any month, any individual who:\", \"Is covered under a HDHP on the first day of such month;\", \"Is not also covered by any other health plan that is not an HDHP (with certain exceptions for plans providing certain limited types of coverage);\", \"Is not entitled to benefits under Medicare (generally, has not yet reached age 65); and\", \"May not be claimed as a dependent on another person's tax return. (IRS Notice 2004-2)\", \"What is an HDHP? \", \"Generally, an HDHP is a health plan that satisfies certain requirements with respect to deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses. The minimum annual deductibles and the maximum out-of-pocket expense limits for HDHP coverage are adjusted for increases in the cost of living. A plan does not fail to qualify as an HDHP merely because it does not have a deductible (or has a small deductible) for preventive care (for example, first dollar coverage for preventive care). However, except for preventive care, a plan may not provide benefits for any year until the deductible for that year is met. (IRS Notice 2004-2)\", \"The minimum annual deductible and maximum out-of-pocket requirements for HDHPs are as follows:\", \"May an HDHP apply any required cost-of-living adjustments to the minimum annual deductible amounts or maximum annual out-of-pocket expense limits on the renewal date of the HDHP if that date is after Jan. 1?\", \"Yes. Generally, an HDHP is a health plan that satisfies certain requirements with respect to minimum annual deductibles and maximum annual out-of-pocket expenses. These annual amounts are indexed for inflation using annual cost-of-living adjustments. Any required change to the deductibles and out-of-pocket expense limits may be applied as of the renewal date of the HDHP in cases where the renewal date is after the beginning of the calendar year, but in no event longer than a 12-month period ending on the renewal date. Thus, a fiscal year plan that satisfies the minimum annual deductible on the first day of the first month of its fiscal year may apply that deductible for the entire fiscal year, even if the minimum annual deductible increases on Jan. 1 of the next calendar year. (IRS Notice 2004-50)\", \"If an employer offers an employee a choice between a low-deductible health plan and an HDHP, and the employee selects coverage only under the HDHP, is the employee an HSA-eligible individual?\", \"Yes, if the employee is otherwise an eligible individual. To determine if an individual is an eligible individual, the actual health coverage selected by the individual is controlling. Thus, it does not matter that the individual could have chosen, but did not choose, a low-deductible health plan or other coverage that would have disqualified the individual from contributing to an HSA. (IRS Notice 2004-50)\", \"May an otherwise eligible individual who is eligible for Medicare, but not enrolled in Medicare Part A or Part B, contribute to an HSA?\", \"Yes. Code Section 223(b)(7) states that an individual ceases to be an eligible individual starting with the month he or she is entitled to benefits under Medicare. Under this provision, mere eligibility for Medicare does not make an individual ineligible to contribute to an HSA. Rather, the term \\u201centitled to benefits under\\u201d Medicare means both eligibility and enrollment in Medicare. Thus, an otherwise eligible individual under Code Section 223(c)(1) who is not actually enrolled in Medicare Part A or Part B may contribute to an HSA until the month that individual is enrolled in Medicare. (IRS Notice 2004-50)\", \"May an otherwise eligible individual who is covered by both an HDHP and also by insurance contracts for one or more specific diseases or illnesses, such as cancer, diabetes, asthma or congestive heart failure, contribute to an HSA if the insurance provides benefits before the deductible of the HDHP is satisfied?\", \"Yes. Code Section 223(c)(1)(B)(i) provides that an eligible individual covered under an HDHP may also be covered \\u201cfor any benefit provided by permitted insurance.\\u201d Code Section 223(c)(3)(B) provides that the term \\u201cpermitted insurance\\u201d includes \\u201cinsurance for a specified disease or illness.\\u201d Therefore, an eligible individual may be covered by an HDHP and also by permitted insurance for one or more specific diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, asthma or congestive heart failure, as long as the principal health coverage is provided by the HDHP. (IRS Notice 2004-50)\", \"May an individual who is covered by an HDHP and who also has a discount card that enables the user to obtain discounts for health care services or products, contribute to an HSA?\", \"Yes. Discount cards that entitle holders to obtain discounts for health care services or products at managed care market rates will not disqualify an individual from being an eligible individual for HSA purposes if the individual is required to pay the costs of the health care (taking into account the discount) until the deductible of the HDHP is satisfied. (IRS Notice 2004-50)\", \"Does coverage under an employee assistance program (EAP), disease management program or wellness program make an individual ineligible to contribute to an HSA?\", \"An individual will not fail to be an eligible individual under Code Section 223(c)(1)(A) solely because the individual is covered under an EAP, disease management program or wellness program, if the program does not provide significant benefits in the nature of medical care or treatment, and, therefore, is not considered a \\u201chealth plan\\u201d for purposes of Code Section 223(c)(1). To determine whether a program provides significant benefits in the nature of medical care or treatment, screening and other preventive care services will be disregarded. (IRS Notice 2004-50)\", \"If an employee begins HDHP coverage mid-month, when does the employee become an eligible individual? (For example, coverage under the HDHP begins on the first day of a biweekly payroll period.)\", \"Under Code Section 223(b)(2), an eligible individual must have HDHP coverage as of the first day of the month. An individual with employer-provided HDHP coverage on a payroll-by-payroll basis becomes an eligible individual on the first day of the month on or following the first day of the pay period when HDHP coverage begins. (IRS Notice 2004-50)\", \"Example: An employee begins HDHP coverage on the first day of a pay period, which is Aug. 16, 2020, and continues to be covered by the HDHP throughout 2020. For purposes of contributing to an HSA, the employee becomes an eligible individual on Sept. 1, 2020.\", \"If an employee is covered by an HDHP and the employer pays or reimburses some or all of the employee\\u2019s medical expenses incurred before the minimum HDHP deductible is satisfied (other than disregarded coverage under Code Section 223(c)(1)(B) or preventive care under Code Section 223(c)(2)(C)), is the employee an eligible individual? \", \"No. To be an eligible individual, an individual must be covered by an HDHP and no other health plan except disregarded coverage or preventive care. If at any time, an employer pays or reimburses, directly or indirectly, all or part of employees\\u2019 medical expenses below the minimum HDHP deductible under Code Section 223(c)(2)(A) (other than for disregarded coverage or preventive care) the employees are not eligible to contribute to an HSA. (IRS Notice 2008-59)\", \"Example: For 2020, an HDHP with self-only coverage has an annual deductible of $2,500. The employee pays the first $250 of covered medical expenses below the deductible. The employer reimburses the next $1,350 of covered medical expenses below the deductible. The employee is responsible for the last $900 of covered medical expenses below the deductible. The $1,350 of medical expenses paid or reimbursed by the employer is not a contribution to an HSA and not disregarded coverage or preventive care. An employee covered by this type of plan is not an eligible individual under Code Section 223(c)(1) because the employee has disqualifying coverage from a plan that is not an HDHP.\", \"May an otherwise eligible individual covered by an HDHP also be covered by a health plan that is not an HDHP with a deductible equal to or greater than the statutory minimum HDHP deductible?\", \"Yes, as long as the deductible of the other coverage equals or exceeds the statutory minimum HDHP deductible, the individual remains an eligible individual. (IRS Notice 2008-59)\", \"Contributions\", \"Who may contribute to an HSA?\", \"Any eligible individual may contribute to an HSA. For an HSA established by an employee, the employee, the employee's employer or both may contribute to the HSA of the employee in a given year. For an HSA established by a self-employed (or unemployed) individual, the individual may contribute to the HSA. Family members may also make contributions to an HSA on behalf of another family member as long as that other family member is an eligible individual. (IRS Notice 2004-2)\", \"In what form must contributions be made to an HSA?\", \"Contributions to an HSA must be made in cash. For example, contributions may not be made in the form of stock or other property. Payments for the HDHP and contributions to the HSA can be made through a cafeteria plan. (IRS Notice 2004-2)\", \"What is the tax treatment of an eligible individual's HSA contributions?\", \"Contributions made by an eligible individual to an HSA are deductible by the eligible individual in determining adjusted gross income (that is, \\u201cabove-the-line\\u201d). The contributions are deductible whether or not the eligible individual itemizes deductions. However, the individual cannot also deduct the contributions as medical expense deductions under Code Section 213. (IRS Notice 2004-2)\", \"What is the tax treatment of employer contributions to an employee's HSA?\", \"In the case of an employee who is an eligible individual, employer contributions (provided they are within the HSA contribution limits for that year) to the employee's HSA are treated as employer-provided coverage for medical expenses under an accident or health plan and are excludable from the employee's gross income. The employer contributions are not subject to withholding from wages for income tax or subject to the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA), the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), or the Railroad Retirement Tax Act. Contributions to an employee's HSA through a cafeteria plan are treated as employer contributions. The employee cannot deduct employer contributions on his or her federal income tax return as HSA contributions or as medical expense deductions under Code Section 213. (IRS Notice 2004-2)\", \"When may HSA contributions be made? Is there a deadline for contributions to an HSA for a taxable year?\", \"Contributions for the taxable year can be made in one or more payments, at the convenience of the individual or the employer, at any time prior to the time prescribed by law (without extensions) for filing the eligible individual's federal income tax return for that year, but not before the beginning of that year. For calendar year taxpayers, the deadline for contributions to an HSA is generally April 15 following the year for which the contributions are made. Although the annual contribution is determined monthly, the maximum contribution may be made on the first day of the year. (IRS Notice 2004-2)\", \"How do the maximum annual HSA contribution limits apply to an eligible individual with family HDHP coverage for the entire year if the family HDHP covers spouses or dependent children who also have coverage by a non-HDHP, Medicare or Medicaid? \", \"The eligible individual may contribute the Code Section 223(b)(2)(B) statutory maximum for family coverage. Other coverage of dependent children or spouses does not affect the individual\\u2019s contribution limit, except that if the spouse is not an otherwise eligible individual, no part of the HSA contribution can be allocated to the spouse. (IRS Notice 2008-59)\", \"How do the maximum annual HSA contribution limits apply to a married couple if both spouses are eligible individuals and one spouse has self-only HDHP coverage and the other spouse has family HDHP coverage? \", \"The maximum annual HSA contribution limit for a married couple, if one spouse has family HDHP coverage and the other spouse has self-only HDHP coverage, is the Code Section 223(b)(2)(B) statutory maximum for family coverage. The contribution limit is divided between the spouses by agreement. This is the result regardless of whether the family HDHP coverage includes the spouse with self-only HDHP coverage. (IRS Notice 2008-59)\", \"Example: For 2020, H and W are married. Both are 40 years old. H and W are otherwise eligible individuals. H has self-only HDHP coverage. W has an HDHP with family coverage for W and their two children. The combined contribution limit for H and W is $7,100, which is the Code Section 223(b)(2)(B) statutory contribution limit for 2020. H and W divide the $7,100 contribution limit between them by agreement.\", \"How do the maximum annual HSA contribution limits apply to a married couple if both spouses are eligible individuals and each spouse has family HDHP coverage that does not cover the other spouse? \", \"The maximum HSA contribution limit for a married couple where both spouses have family HDHP coverage is the Code Section 223(b)(2)(B) statutory maximum. This rule applies regardless of whether each spouse\\u2019s family coverage covers the other spouse. The contribution limit is divided between the spouses by agreement. (IRS Notice 2008-59)\", \"May an individual who ceases to be an eligible individual during a year still contribute to an HSA with respect to the months of the year when the individual was an eligible individual? \", \"Yes. An individual who ceases to be an eligible individual may, until the date for filing the return (without extensions) for the year, make HSA contributions with respect to the months of the year when the individual was an eligible individual.

(IRS Notice 2008-59)\", \"May employer contributions to employees\\u2019 HSAs made between Jan. 1 and the date for filing the employee\\u2019s return, without extensions, be allocated to the prior year? \", \"Yes. For employer contributions (including salary reduction contributions) made between Jan. 1 and the date for filing the employees\\u2019 returns without extension, the employer must notify the HSA trustee or custodian if the contributions relate to the prior year. The employer must also inform the employee of the designation.
