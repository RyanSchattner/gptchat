"[\"\", \"Employee Severance Agreements \\u2013 Waivers of Discrimination Claims\", \"An employer\\u2019s decision to terminate or lay off certain employees, while retaining others, may lead discharged workers to believe that they were discriminated against based on their age, race, sex, national origin, religion or disability. To minimize the risk of potential litigation, many employers offer departing employees money or benefits in exchange for a release (or waiver) of liability for all claims connected with the employment relationship, including discrimination claims under federal civil rights laws enforced by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). \", \"This Compliance Overview provides a basic overview of severance agreements, explains when a waiver is valid and specifically addresses waivers of age discrimination claims that must comply with the Older Workers Benefit Protection Act (OWBPA). This information is based on guidance issued by the EEOC regarding waivers of discrimination claims in severance agreements. \", \"severance agreements \", \"A severance agreement is a contract, or legal agreement, between an employer and an employee that specifies the terms of an employment termination, such as a layoff. Sometimes this agreement is called a \\u201cseparation\\u201d or \\u201ctermination\\u201d agreement or \\u201cseparation agreement general release and covenant not to sue.\\u201d\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"The consideration offered for the waiver of the right to sue cannot simply be a pension benefit or payment for earned vacation or sick leave to which the employee is already entitled. Instead, consideration must be something of value in addition to the employee\\u2019s existing entitlements, such as a lump sum payment of a percentage of the employee\\u2019s annual salary or periodic payments of the employee\\u2019s salary for a specified period of time after termination. The employee\\u2019s signature and retention of the consideration generally indicates acceptance of the terms of the agreement.\", \"What does a severance agreement look like?\", \"A severance agreement often is written like a contract or letter, and generally includes a list of numbered paragraphs setting forth specific terms regarding the date of termination, severance payments, benefits, references, return of company property and release of claims against the employer. If an employer decides to terminate an employee, it may give that employee a severance agreement similar to the one that follows:\", \"Agreements that specifically cover the release of age claims will also include additional information intended to comply with OWBPA requirements. \", \"\", \"\", \"VALIDITY OF WAIVERS\\u2014IN GENERAL\", \"Most employees who sign waivers in severance agreements never attempt to challenge them. Some discharged employees, however, may feel that they have no choice but to sign the waiver, even though they suspect discrimination or learn something after signing the waiver that leads them to believe they were discriminated against during employment or wrongfully terminated.\", \"If an employee who signed a waiver later files a lawsuit alleging discrimination, the employer will argue that the court should dismiss the case because the employee waived the right to sue. The employee will respond that the waiver should not bind him or her because it is legally invalid. Before looking at the employee\\u2019s discrimination claim, a court first will decide whether the waiver is valid. If a court concludes that the waiver is invalid, it will decide the employee\\u2019s discrimination claim, but will dismiss the claim if it finds that the waiver is valid.\", \"A waiver in a severance agreement generally is valid when an employee knowingly and voluntarily consents to the waiver. The rules regarding whether a waiver is knowing and voluntary depend on the applicable statute. The rules for waivers under the ADEA are defined by the OWBPA. Under other laws, such as Title VII, the rules are derived from case law.  \", \"\", \"\", \"What determines whether a waiver of rights under Title VII, the ADA or the EPA was \\u201cknowing and voluntary?\\u201d\", \"To determine whether an employee knowingly and voluntarily waived his or her discrimination claims, some courts rely on traditional contract principles and focus primarily on whether the language in the waiver is clear. Most courts, however, look beyond the contract language and consider all relevant factors\\u2014or the totality of the circumstances\\u2014to determine whether the employee knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to sue. These courts consider the following circumstances and conditions under which the waiver was signed:\", \"Whether it was written in a manner that was clear and specific enough for the employee to understand, based on his or her education and business experience;\", \"Whether it was induced by fraud, duress, undue influence or other improper conduct by the employer;\", \"Whether the employee had enough time to read and think about the advantages and disadvantages of the agreement before signing it;\", \"Whether the employee consulted with an attorney, or was encouraged or discouraged by the employer from doing so;\", \"Whether the employee had any input in negotiating the terms of the agreement; and\", \"Whether the employer offered the employee consideration that exceeded what the employee already was entitled to by law or contract and the employee accepted the offered consideration.\", \"May I still file a charge with the EEOC if I believe that I have been discriminated against based on my age, race, sex or disability, even if I signed a waiver releasing my employer from all claims?\", \"Yes. Although your severance agreement may use broad language to describe the claims that you are releasing (see Example 1), you can still file a charge with the EEOC if you believe you were discriminated against or wrongfully terminated. In addition, no agreement between you and your employer can limit your right to testify, assist or participate in an investigation, hearing or proceeding conducted by the EEOC under the ADEA, Title VII, the ADA or the EPA. Any provision in a waiver that attempts to waive these rights is invalid and unenforceable.\", \"If I file a charge with the EEOC after signing a waiver, will I have to return my severance pay?\", \"No. Because provisions in severance agreements that attempt to prevent employees from filing a charge with the EEOC or participating in an EEOC investigation, hearing or proceeding are unenforceable (see above), you cannot be required to return your severance pay (or any other consideration) before filing a charge.\", \"Will I have to return my severance pay if I file a discrimination suit in court after signing a waiver?\", \"Under the ADEA, an employee is not required to return severance pay (or other consideration received for signing the waiver) before filing an age discrimination claim. Under Title VII, the ADA or the EPA, however, the law is less clear. Some courts conclude that the validity of the waiver cannot be challenged unless the employee returns the consideration, while other courts apply the ADEA\\u2019s \\u201cno tender back\\u201d rule to claims brought under Title VII and other discrimination statutes, and allow employees to proceed with their claims without first returning the consideration.\", \"Even if a court does not require you to return the consideration before proceeding with your lawsuit, it may reduce the amount of any money you are awarded if your suit is successful by the amount of consideration you received for signing the waiver. \", \"WAIVERS OF ADEA CLAIMS\\u2014GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR EMPLOYEES AGE 40 AND OVER\", \"In 1990, Congress amended the ADEA by adding the OWBPA to clarify the prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of age. The OWBPA establishes specific requirements for a \\u201cknowing and voluntary\\u201d release of ADEA claims to guarantee that an employee has every opportunity to make an informed choice whether or not to sign the waiver. There are additional disclosure requirements under the statute when waivers are requested from a group or class of employees. \", \"What makes a waiver of age claims knowing and voluntary?\", \"The OWBPA lists seven factors that must be satisfied for a waiver of age discrimination claims to be considered \\u201cknowing and voluntary.\\u201d At a minimum:\", \"If a waiver of age claims fails to meet any of these seven requirements, it is invalid and unenforceable. In addition, an employer cannot attempt to \\u201ccure\\u201d a defective waiver by issuing a subsequent letter containing OWBPA-required information that was omitted from the original agreement.\", \"Are there other factors that may make a waiver of age claims invalid?\", \"Yes. Even when a waiver complies with OWBPA\\u2019s requirements, a waiver of age claims (like waivers of Title VII and other discrimination claims) will be invalid and unenforceable if an employer used fraud, undue influence or other improper conduct to coerce the employee to sign it, or if it contains a material mistake, omission or misstatement.\", \"If I am 40 years old or older, am I entitled to more severance pay or benefits than a younger employee?\", \"No. Although severance packages often are structured differently for different employees depending on position and tenure, an employer is not required to give you a greater amount of consideration than is given to a person under the age of 40 solely because you are protected by the ADEA.\", \"Are there any circumstances where I may have to pay my employer back the money it gave me for the waiver of my age claims?\", \"Yes. Your employer may offset money it paid you in exchange for waiving your rights if you successfully challenge the waiver, prove age discrimination and obtain a monetary award. However, your employer\\u2019s recovery may not exceed the amount it paid for the waiver (or the amount of your award, if it is less).\", \"\", \"If I challenge an age discrimination waiver in court, may my employer renege on promises it made in the agreement?\", \"No. EEOC regulations state that an employer cannot abrogate, or avoid, its duties under an ADEA waiver, even if you challenge it. Because you have a right under the OWBPA to have a court determine a waiver\\u2019s validity, it is unlawful for your employer to stop making promised severance payments or to withhold any other benefits it agreed to provide.\", \"WAIVERS OF ADEA CLAIMS\\u2014ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GROUP LAYOFFS OF EMPLOYEES AGE 40 AND OVER\", \"When employers decide to reduce their workforce by laying off or terminating a group of employees, they usually do so pursuant to two types of programs: exit incentive programs and other employment termination programs. When a waiver is offered to employees in connection with one of these types of programs, an employer must provide enough information about the factors it used in making selections to allow employees who were laid off to determine whether older employees were terminated while younger ones were retained.\", \"What is an \\u201cexit incentive\\u201d or \\u201cother termination\\u201d program?\", \"Typically, an \\u201cexit incentive program\\u201d is a voluntary program where an employer offers two or more employees, such as older employees or those in specific organizational units or job functions, additional consideration to persuade them to voluntarily resign and sign a waiver. An \\u201cother employment termination program\\u201d generally refers to a program where two or more employees are involuntarily terminated and are offered additional consideration in return for their decision to sign a waiver.\", \"Whether a \\u201cprogram\\u201d exists depends on the facts and circumstances of each case; however, the general rule is that a program exists if an employer offers additional consideration (or an incentive to leave) in exchange for signing a waiver to more than one employee. By contrast, if a large employer terminated five employees in different units for cause (for example, poor performance) over the course of several days or months, it is unlikely that a program exists. In both exit incentive and other termination programs, the employer determines the terms of the severance agreement, which typically are non-negotiable.\", \"If I am in a group of employees who are being laid off and I am asked to sign a waiver, what information does my employer have to give to me?\", \"Your waiver must meet the minimum OWBPA \\\"knowing and voluntary\\\" requirements. In addition, your employer must give all employees who are being laid off written notice of the layoff and at least 45 days to consider the waiver before signing it. Specifically, the employer must inform you in writing of:\", \"The \\\"decisional unit\\\"\\u2014The class, unit or group of employees from which the employer chose the employees who were and were not selected for the program (the particular circumstances of each termination program determine whether the decisional unit is the entire company, a division, a department, employees reporting to a particular manager or workers in a specific job classification);\", \"Eligibility factors for the program;\", \"The time limits applicable to the program; and\", \"The job titles and ages of all individuals who are eligible or who were selected for the program (the use of age bands broader than one year, such as \\\"age 40-50,\\\" does not satisfy this requirement) and the ages of all individuals in the same job classifications or organizational unit who are not eligible or who were not selected.\", \"See Appendix B for an example of an agreement issued to employees being laid off or terminated pursuant to a group exit incentive program.\", \"CONCLUSION\", \"If an employer decides to terminate an employee's job, that employee may be given a severance agreement that requires the employee to waive the right to sue for wrongful termination based on age, race, sex, disability and other types of discrimination. Although most signed waivers are enforceable if they meet certain contract principles and statutory requirements, an employer cannot lawfully limit an employee's right to testify, assist or participate in an investigation, hearing or proceeding conducted by the EEOC or prevent an employee from filing a charge of discrimination with the agency. \", \"An employer also cannot lawfully require an employee to return the money or benefits it gave the employee in exchange for waiving rights if the employee does file a charge. While this document is not intended to cover all of the issues that arise when an employer informs an employee that he or she is being terminated or laid off, the following checklist may help an employee decide whether or not to sign a waiver.\", \"Source: Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\", \"\\nAPPENDIX A\", \"Employee Checklist: What to Do When Your Employer Offers You a Severance Agreement\", \"Make sure that you understand the agreement.\", \"Read the agreement to see if it is clear and specific, or if it is confusing because it contains terms you do not understand.\", \"If you are 40 or older, inform your employer that the law requires your agreement to be written in a manner that makes it easy to understand. Usually this means that your agreement should not contain technical jargon or long, complex sentences.\", \"Check for deadlines and act promptly.\", \"The moment you are given a severance agreement, check to see if your employer gave you a deadline for accepting or declining the agreement. If you are 40 years old or older, federal law requires the employer to give you at least 21 days to review the agreement and make up your mind.\", \"If your employer has not given you a reasonable amount of time, or rushes your decision, this is a red flag. An employer who is fair will understand that you cannot review or make decisions about an important document on a moment\\u2019s notice.\", \"If you are being rushed, ask for more time. Put your request in writing. If you are 40 or older and your employer is asking you for a decision in fewer than 21 days, remind the employer that the law requires you to be provided at least 21 days.
