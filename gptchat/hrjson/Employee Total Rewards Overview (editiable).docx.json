A 5-point scale is recommended to allow for gradations in perceptions (versus a series of \\\"Yes-No\\\" questions). In addition, to help the employer determine employee priorities and preferences, the survey should include a ranking section as well as several open-ended questions. Survey administration must protect employee confidentiality. Electronic administration, using outside data capture and analysis (for example, internet-based Survey Monkey or Zoomerang), is desirable. \", \"Data should be analyzed for overall trends across all respondents and, if relevant, broken down by large, intact departments, organizational units and/or demographic groups. HR should be responsible for administration, data analysis and reporting. Reporting should begin with senior leadership, but then be shared with all employees. \", \"Once the data has been analyzed, HR may decide to convene a number of small focus groups to help the Employer better understand the survey results and obtain more in-depth feedback.
