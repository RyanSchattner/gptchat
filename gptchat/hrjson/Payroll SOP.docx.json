"[\"Payroll Department\", \"Overview\", \"The payroll department is currently 4 employees.  Our payroll is run every week on Thursday for a Friday pay date.

One of the biggest struggles in the payroll department is the lack of accountability in other departments that lead to extra work in the department fixing issues such as missed punches, one off deals, exceptions to the rules, incorrect information in the system, or lack of communication regarding changes.\", \"To minimize the after-payroll fixes, we have moved to a proactive approach to the problems we know occur on a weekly basis.  One of the biggest issues we have is missed punches.  While this may sound small, it can put us out of compliance in the easiest and most costly violation of labor laws.  If an employer does not accurately pay all wages on the designated pay day, there are penalties that pile up.  Paystub violations are the biggest as when you miss any type of pay, not only is the pay missing but proper paystub reporting is as well.  We have now put in place a Monday audit that we pull all hours from WebTime and audit for missing or unusual punches.  This is a tedious task, however, since implementing this process in February of 2021, we have not had to process any hourly corrections after payroll is processed.  \", \"The time keeping policy is in place and the managers are aware of this policy as it is the biggest topic of discussion when we discuss potential fixes.  This is an issue that the department itself can not fix but with the actual follow through from managers on adhering to the policy could help.  \", \"The other biggest struggle is that the team is all processors and I don\\u2019t currently have a \\u201clead\\u201d who has knowledge of the \\u201cwhy\\u201d behind the things that we do.  This has lead to a lot of questions being asked when anything outside of the norm occurs.  We are currently working on training a lead in the department but this is taking time.
