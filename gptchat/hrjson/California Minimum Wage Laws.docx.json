California law complements federal law and, in some cases, prescribes more stringent or additional requirements that employers must follow. Whenever employers are subject to both state and federal laws, the law most favorable to the employee will apply. \", \"The Division of Labor Standards Enforcement (DLSE), part of the California Department of Industrial Relations, enforces and investigates minimum wage violation claims.\", \"Minimum Wage Rates\", \"Effective Jan. 1, 2020, the minimum wage rate in California is $13 per hour for employers with 26 or more employees and $12 per hour for employers with 25 or fewer employees.
